Subject: mac80211: always wind down STA state

From: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit dcd479e10a0510522a5d88b29b8f79ea3467d501 ]

When (for example) an IBSS station is pre-moved to AUTHORIZED
before it's inserted, and then the insertion fails, we don't
clean up the fast RX/TX states that might already have been
created, since we don't go through all the state transitions
again on the way down.

Do that, if it hasn't been done already, when the station is
freed. I considered only freeing the fast TX/RX state there,
but we might add more state so it's more robust to wind down
the state properly.

Note that we warn if the station was ever inserted, it should
have been properly cleaned up in that case, and the driver
will probably not like things happening out of order.
