Subject: PM: runtime: Add pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter

From: Zhang Qilong <zhangqilong3@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit dd8088d5a8969dc2b42f71d7bc01c25c61a78066 ]

In many case, we need to check return value of pm_runtime_get_sync, but
it brings a trouble to the usage counter processing. Many callers forget
to decrease the usage counter when it failed, which could resulted in
reference leak. It has been discussed a lot[0][1]. So we add a function
to deal with the usage counter for better coding.
