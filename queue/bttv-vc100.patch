Subject: [PATCH] Fix for bttv driver (v0.9.15) for Leadtek WinFast VC100 XP capture cards

Cc: kraxel@bytesex.org

This is a tiny patch that fixes bttv-cards.c so that Leadtek WinFast
VC100 XP video capture cards work. I've been advised to post it here
after having already posted it to the v4l mailing list.
