Subject: selftests: rtnetlink: remove netdevsim device after ipsec offload
 test

From: Sabrina Dubroca <sd@queasysnail.net>

[ Upstream commit 5f789f103671fec3733ebe756e56adf15c90c21d ]

On systems where netdevsim is built-in or loaded before the test
starts, kci_test_ipsec_offload doesn't remove the netdevsim device it
created during the test.

Fixes: e05b2d141fef ("netdevsim: move netdev creation/destruction to dev probe")
