Subject: kernel: don't call do_exit() for PF_IO_WORKER threads

From: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>

[ Upstream commit 10442994ba195efef6fdcc0c3699e4633cb5161b ]

Right now we're never calling get_signal() from PF_IO_WORKER threads, but
in preparation for doing so, don't handle a fatal signal for them. The
workers have state they need to cleanup when exiting, so just return
instead of calling do_exit() on their behalf. The threads themselves will
detect a fatal signal and do proper shutdown.
