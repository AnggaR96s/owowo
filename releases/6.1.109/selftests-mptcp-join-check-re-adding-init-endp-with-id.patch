From: "Matthieu Baerts (NGI0)" <matttbe@kernel.org>

commit 1c2326fcae4f0c5de8ad0d734ced43a8e5f17dac upstream.

The initial subflow has a special local ID: 0. It is specific per
connection.

When a global endpoint is deleted and re-added later, it can have a
different ID, but the kernel should still use the ID 0 if it corresponds
to the initial address.

This test validates this behaviour: the endpoint linked to the initial
subflow is removed, and re-added with a different ID.

Note that removing the initial subflow will not decrement the 'subflows'
counters, which corresponds to the *additional* subflows. On the other
hand, when the same endpoint is re-added, it will increment this
counter, as it will be seen as an additional subflow this time.

The 'Fixes' tag here below is the same as the one from the previous
commit: this patch here is not fixing anything wrong in the selftests,
but it validates the previous fix for an issue introduced by this commit
ID.

[ Conflicts in mptcp_join.sh, because the helpers are different in this
  version:
  - run_tests has been modified a few times to reduce the number of
    positional parameters
  - no chk_mptcp_info helper
  - chk_subflow_nr taking an extra parameter
  - kill_tests_wait instead of mptcp_lib_kill_wait ]
