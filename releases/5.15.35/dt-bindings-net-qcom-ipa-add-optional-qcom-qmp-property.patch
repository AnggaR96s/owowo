Subject: dt-bindings: net: qcom,ipa: add optional qcom,qmp property

From: Alex Elder <elder@linaro.org>

commit ac62a0174d62ae0f4447c0c8cf35a8e5d793df56 upstream.

For some systems, the IPA driver must make a request to ensure that
its registers are retained across power collapse of the IPA hardware.
On such systems, we'll use the existence of the "qcom,qmp" property
as a signal that this request is required.
