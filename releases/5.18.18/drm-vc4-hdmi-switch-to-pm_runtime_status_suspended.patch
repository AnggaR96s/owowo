Subject: drm/vc4: hdmi: Switch to pm_runtime_status_suspended

From: Dave Stevenson <dave.stevenson@raspberrypi.com>

[ Upstream commit fcef97e70094a33ded73b3eb9bef06698c6e9c12 ]

If the controller isn't clocked or its domain powered up, the register
accesses will either stall the CPU or return garbage, respectively.

Thus, we had a warning in our register access function to complain when
that kind of risky accesses were performed.

In order to check the runtime_pm power state, we were using
pm_runtime_active(), but it turns out that it will become active only
once the runtime_resume hook has been executed.

This prevents us from doing any WARN-free register access in our
runtime_resume() implementation, while this is valid.

Let's switch to pm_runtime_status_suspended() instead.

Fixes: 14e193b95604 ("drm/vc4: hdmi: Warn if we access the controller while disabled")
