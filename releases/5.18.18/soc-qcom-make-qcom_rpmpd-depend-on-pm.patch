Subject: soc: qcom: Make QCOM_RPMPD depend on PM

From: Konrad Dybcio <konrad.dybcio@somainline.org>

[ Upstream commit a6232f2aa99ce470799992e99e0012945bb5308f ]

QCOM_RPMPD requires PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS/_OF, which in turns requires
CONFIG_PM. I forgot about the latter in my earlier patch (it's still
in -next as of the time of committing, hence no Fixes: tag). Fix it.
