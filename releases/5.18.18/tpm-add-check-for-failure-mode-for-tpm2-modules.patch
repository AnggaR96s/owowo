[ Upstream commit 863ed94c589fcd1984f4e3080f069d30508044bb ]

In commit 0aa698787aa2 ("tpm: Add Upgrade/Reduced mode support for
TPM2 modules") it was said that:

"If the TPM is in Failure mode, it will successfully respond to both
tpm2_do_selftest() and tpm2_startup() calls. Although, will fail to
answer to tpm2_get_cc_attrs_tbl(). Use this fact to conclude that TPM
is in Failure mode."

But a check was never added in the commit when calling
tpm2_get_cc_attrs_tbl() to conclude that the TPM is in Failure mode.
This commit corrects this by adding a check.
