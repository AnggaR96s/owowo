Subject: crypto: ccp - During shutdown, check SEV data pointer before using

From: Tom Lendacky <thomas.lendacky@amd.com>

[ Upstream commit 1b05ece0c931536c0a38a9385e243a7962e933f6 ]

On shutdown, each CCP device instance performs shutdown processing.
However, __sev_platform_shutdown_locked() uses the controlling psp
structure to obtain the pointer to the sev_device structure. However,
during driver initialization, it is possible that an error can be received
from the firmware that results in the sev_data pointer being cleared from
the controlling psp structure. The __sev_platform_shutdown_locked()
function does not check for this situation and will segfault.

While not common, this scenario should be accounted for. Add a check for a
NULL sev_device structure before attempting to use it.
