Subject: habanalabs: fix DRAM usage accounting on context tear down

[ Upstream commit c8113756ba27298d6e95403c087dc5881b419a99 ]

The patch fix the DRAM usage accounting by adding a missing update of
the DRAM memory consumption, when a context is being torn down without an
organized release of the allocated memory.
