Subject: selftests/mm: fix incorrect buffer->mirror size in hmm2 double_map

[ Upstream commit 76503e1fa1a53ef041a120825d5ce81c7fe7bdd7 ]

The hmm2 double_map test was failing due to an incorrect buffer->mirror
size.  The buffer->mirror size was 6, while buffer->ptr size was 6 *
PAGE_SIZE.  The test failed because the kernel's copy_to_user function was
attempting to copy a 6 * PAGE_SIZE buffer to buffer->mirror.  Since the
size of buffer->mirror was incorrect, copy_to_user failed.

This patch corrects the buffer->mirror size to 6 * PAGE_SIZE.

Test Result without this patch
==============================
 #  RUN           hmm2.hmm2_device_private.double_map ...
 # hmm-tests.c:1680:double_map:Expected ret (-14) == 0 (0)
 # double_map: Test terminated by assertion
 #          FAIL  hmm2.hmm2_device_private.double_map
 not ok 53 hmm2.hmm2_device_private.double_map

Test Result with this patch
===========================
 #  RUN           hmm2.hmm2_device_private.double_map ...
 #            OK  hmm2.hmm2_device_private.double_map
 ok 53 hmm2.hmm2_device_private.double_map
