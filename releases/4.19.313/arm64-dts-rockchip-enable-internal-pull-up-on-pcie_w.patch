Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: enable internal pull-up on PCIE_WAKE# for
 RK3399 Puma

From: Quentin Schulz <quentin.schulz@theobroma-systems.com>

[ Upstream commit 945a7c8570916650a415757d15d83e0fa856a686 ]

The PCIE_WAKE# has a diode used as a level-shifter, and is used as an
input pin. While the SoC default is to enable the pull-up, the core
rk3399 pinconf for this pin opted for pull-none. So as to not disturb
the behaviour of other boards which may rely on pull-none instead of
pull-up, set the needed pull-up only for RK3399 Puma.
