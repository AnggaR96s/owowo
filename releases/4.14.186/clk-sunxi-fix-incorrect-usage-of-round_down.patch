Subject: clk: sunxi: Fix incorrect usage of round_down()

From: Rikard Falkeborn <rikard.falkeborn@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit ee25d9742dabed3fd18158b518f846abeb70f319 ]

round_down() can only round to powers of 2. If round_down() is asked
to round to something that is not a power of 2, incorrect results are
produced. The incorrect results can be both too large and too small.

Instead, use rounddown() which can round to any number.
