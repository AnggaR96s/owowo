Subject: mtd: mchp48l640: Add SPI ID table

From: Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 69a6d06878f05d63673b0dcdc3c3ef1af2996d46 ]

Currently autoloading for SPI devices does not use the DT ID table, it uses
SPI modalises. Supporting OF modalises is going to be difficult if not
impractical, an attempt was made but has been reverted, so ensure that
module autoloading works for this driver by adding an id_table listing the
SPI IDs for everything.

Fixes: 96c8395e2166 ("spi: Revert modalias changes")
