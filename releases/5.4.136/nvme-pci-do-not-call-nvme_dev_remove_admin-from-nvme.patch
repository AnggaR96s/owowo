Subject: nvme-pci: do not call nvme_dev_remove_admin from nvme_remove

From: Casey Chen <cachen@purestorage.com>

[ Upstream commit 251ef6f71be2adfd09546a26643426fe62585173 ]

nvme_dev_remove_admin could free dev->admin_q and the admin_tagset
while they are being accessed by nvme_dev_disable(), which can be called
by nvme_reset_work via nvme_remove_dead_ctrl.

Commit cb4bfda62afa ("nvme-pci: fix hot removal during error handling")
intended to avoid requests being stuck on a removed controller by killing
the admin queue. But the later fix c8e9e9b7646e ("nvme-pci: unquiesce
admin queue on shutdown"), together with nvme_dev_disable(dev, true)
right before nvme_dev_remove_admin() could help dispatch requests and
fail them early, so we don't need nvme_dev_remove_admin() any more.
