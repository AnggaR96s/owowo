From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

commit 8dce06e98c70a7fcbb4bca7d90faf40522e65c58 upstream.

In order for the dentries to stay up-to-date with the eventfs changes,
just add a 'd_revalidate' function that checks the 'is_freed' bit.

Also, clean up the dentry release to actually use d_release() rather
than the slightly odd d_iput() function.  We don't care about the inode,
all we want to do is to get rid of the refcount to the eventfs data
added by dentry->d_fsdata.

It would probably be cleaner to make eventfs its own filesystem, or at
least set its own dentry ops when looking up eventfs files.  But as it
is, only eventfs dentries use d_fsdata, so we don't really need to split
these things up by use.

Another thing that might be worth doing is to make all eventfs lookups
mark their dentries as not worth caching.  We could do that with
d_delete(), but the DCACHE_DONTCACHE flag would likely be even better.

As it is, the dentries are all freeable, but they only tend to get freed
at memory pressure rather than more proactively.  But that's a separate
issue.
