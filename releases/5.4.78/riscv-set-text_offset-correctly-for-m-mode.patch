Subject: riscv: Set text_offset correctly for M-Mode

From: Sean Anderson <seanga2@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 79605f1394261995c2b955c906a5a20fb27cdc84 ]

M-Mode Linux is loaded at the start of RAM, not 2MB later. Perhaps this
should be calculated based on PAGE_OFFSET somehow? Even better would be to
deprecate text_offset and instead introduce something absolute.
