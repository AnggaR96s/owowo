Subject: net: ena: Fix potential sign extension issue

From: David Arinzon <darinzon@amazon.com>

[ Upstream commit 713a85195aad25d8a26786a37b674e3e5ec09e3c ]

Small unsigned types are promoted to larger signed types in
the case of multiplication, the result of which may overflow.
In case the result of such a multiplication has its MSB
turned on, it will be sign extended with '1's.
This changes the multiplication result.

Code example of the phenomenon:
-------------------------------
u16 x, y;
size_t z1, z2;

x = y = 0xffff;
printk("x=%x y=%x\n",x,y);

z1 = x*y;
z2 = (size_t)x*y;

printk("z1=%lx z2=%lx\n", z1, z2);

Output:
-------
x=ffff y=ffff
z1=fffffffffffe0001 z2=fffe0001

The expected result of ffff*ffff is fffe0001, and without the
explicit casting to avoid the unwanted sign extension we got
fffffffffffe0001.

This commit adds an explicit casting to avoid the sign extension
issue.
