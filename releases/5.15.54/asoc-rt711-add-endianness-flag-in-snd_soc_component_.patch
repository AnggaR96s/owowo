Subject: ASoC: rt711: Add endianness flag in snd_soc_component_driver

From: Charles Keepax <ckeepax@opensource.cirrus.com>

[ Upstream commit 33f06beac3ade10834a82ad4105dcd91d4b00d61 ]

The endianness flag is used on the CODEC side to specify an
ambivalence to endian, typically because it is lost over the hardware
link. This device receives audio over a SoundWire DAI and as such
should have endianness applied.
