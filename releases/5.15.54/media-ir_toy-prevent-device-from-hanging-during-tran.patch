Subject: media: ir_toy: prevent device from hanging during transmit

From: Sean Young <sean@mess.org>

[ Upstream commit 4114978dcd24e72415276bba60ff4ff355970bbc ]

If the IR Toy is receiving IR while a transmit is done, it may end up
hanging. We can prevent this from happening by re-entering sample mode
just before issuing the transmit command.
