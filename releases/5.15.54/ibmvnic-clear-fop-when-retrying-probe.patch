Subject: ibmvnic: clear fop when retrying probe

From: Sukadev Bhattiprolu <sukadev@linux.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit f628ad531b4f34fdba0984255b4a2850dd369513 ]

Clear ->failover_pending flag that may have been set in the previous
pass of registering CRQ. If we don't clear, a subsequent ibmvnic_open()
call would be misled into thinking a failover is pending and assuming
that the reset worker thread would open the adapter. If this pass of
registering the CRQ succeeds (i.e there is no transport event), there
wouldn't be a reset worker thread.

This would leave the adapter unconfigured and require manual intervention
to bring it up during boot.

Fixes: 5a18e1e0c193 ("ibmvnic: Fix failover case for non-redundant configuration")
