Subject: xfs: mark dir corrupt when lookup-by-hash fails

From: Darrick J. Wong <darrick.wong@oracle.com>

[ Upstream commit 2e107cf869eecc770e3f630060bb4e5f547d0fd8 ]

In xchk_dir_actor, we attempt to validate the directory hash structures
by performing a directory entry lookup by (hashed) name.  If the lookup
returns ENOENT, that means that the hash information is corrupt.  The
_process_error functions don't catch this, so we have to add that
explicitly.
