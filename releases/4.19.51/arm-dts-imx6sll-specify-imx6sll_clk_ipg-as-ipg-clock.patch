Subject: ARM: dts: imx6sll: Specify IMX6SLL_CLK_IPG as "ipg" clock to SDMA

[ Upstream commit c5ed5daa65d5f665e666b76c3dbfa503066defde ]

Since 25aaa75df1e6 SDMA driver uses clock rates of "ipg" and "ahb"
clock to determine if it needs to configure the IP block as operating
at 1:1 or 1:2 clock ratio (ACR bit in SDMAARM_CONFIG). Specifying both
clocks as IMX6SLL_CLK_SDMA result in driver incorrectly thinking that
ratio is 1:1 which results in broken SDMA funtionality. Fix the code
to specify IMX6SLL_CLK_IPG as "ipg" clock for SDMA, to avoid detecting
incorrect clock ratio.
