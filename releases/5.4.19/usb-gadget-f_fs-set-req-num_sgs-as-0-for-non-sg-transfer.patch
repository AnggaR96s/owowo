Subject: usb: gadget: f_fs: set req->num_sgs as 0 for non-sg transfer

From: Peter Chen <peter.chen@nxp.com>

commit d2450c6937018d40d4111fe830fa48d4ddceb8d0 upstream.

The UDC core uses req->num_sgs to judge if scatter buffer list is used.
Eg: usb_gadget_map_request_by_dev. For f_fs sync io mode, the request
is re-used for each request, so if the 1st request->length > PAGE_SIZE,
and the 2nd request->length is <= PAGE_SIZE, the f_fs uses the 1st
req->num_sgs for the 2nd request, it causes the UDC core get the wrong
req->num_sgs value (The 2nd request doesn't use sg). For f_fs async
io mode, it is not harm to initialize req->num_sgs as 0 either, in case,
the UDC driver doesn't zeroed request structure.
