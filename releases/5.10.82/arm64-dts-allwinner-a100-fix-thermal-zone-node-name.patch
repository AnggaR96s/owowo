Subject: arm64: dts: allwinner: a100: Fix thermal zone node name

From: Maxime Ripard <maxime@cerno.tech>

[ Upstream commit 5c34c4e46e601554bfa370b23c8ae3c3c734e9f7 ]

The thermal zones one the A100 are called $device-thermal-zone.

However, the thermal zone binding explicitly requires that zones are
called *-thermal. Let's fix it.
