Subject: Revert "x86/setup: don't remove E820_TYPE_RAM for pfn 0"

From: Mike Rapoport <rppt@linux.ibm.com>

commit 5c279c4cf206e03995e04fd3404fa95ffd243a97 upstream.

This reverts commit bde9cfa3afe4324ec251e4af80ebf9b7afaf7afe.

Changing the first memory page type from E820_TYPE_RESERVED to
E820_TYPE_RAM makes it a part of "System RAM" resource rather than a
reserved resource and this in turn causes devmem_is_allowed() to treat
is as area that can be accessed but it is filled with zeroes instead of
the actual data as previously.

The change in /dev/mem output causes lilo to fail as was reported at
slakware users forum, and probably other legacy applications will
experience similar problems.
