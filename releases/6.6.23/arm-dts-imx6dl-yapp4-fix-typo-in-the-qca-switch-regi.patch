Subject: ARM: dts: imx6dl-yapp4: Fix typo in the QCA switch register address

[ Upstream commit 023bd910d3ab735459f84b22bb99fb9e00bd9d76 ]

This change does not have any functional effect. The switch works just
fine without this patch as it has full access to all the addresses
on the bus. This is simply a clean-up to set the node name address
and reg address to the same value.
