Subject: pwm: imx1: Don't disable clocks at device remove time

[ Upstream commit 1bc6ea31cb41d50302a3c9b401964cf0a88d41f9 ]

The .remove() callback disables clocks that were not enabled in
.probe(). So just probing and then unbinding the driver results in a clk
enable imbalance.

So just drop the call to disable the clocks. (Which BTW was also in the
wrong order because the call makes the PWM unfunctional and so should
have come only after pwmchip_remove()).

Fixes: 9f4c8f9607c3 ("pwm: imx: Add ipg clock operation")
