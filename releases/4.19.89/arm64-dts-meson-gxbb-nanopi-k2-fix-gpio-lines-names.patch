Subject: arm64: dts: meson-gxbb-nanopi-k2: fix GPIO lines names

From: Neil Armstrong <narmstrong@baylibre.com>

[ Upstream commit f0783f5edb52af14ecaae6c5ce4f38e0a358f5d8 ]

The gpio line names were set in the pinctrl node instead of the gpio node,
at the time it was merged, it worked, but was obviously wrong.
This patch moves the properties to the gpio nodes.

Fixes: 12ada0513d7a ("ARM64: dts: meson-gxbb-nanopi-k2: Add GPIO lines names")
