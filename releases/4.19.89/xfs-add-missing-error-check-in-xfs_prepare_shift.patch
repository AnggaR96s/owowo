Subject: xfs: add missing error check in xfs_prepare_shift()

From: Brian Foster <bfoster@redhat.com>

commit 1749d1ea89bdf3181328b7d846e609d5a0e53e50 upstream.

xfs_prepare_shift() fails to check the error return from
xfs_flush_unmap_range(). If the latter fails, that could lead to an
insert/collapse range operation over a delalloc range, which is not
supported.

Add an error check and return appropriately. This is reproduced
rarely by generic/475.

Fixes: 7f9f71be84bc ("xfs: extent shifting doesn't fully invalidate page cache")
