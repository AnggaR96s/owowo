Subject: ARM: dts: sun4i: Fix HDMI output DTC warning

From: Maxime Ripard <maxime.ripard@bootlin.com>

[ Upstream commit 123b796d3fac60d69a3737d81901ab483c4efd6e ]

Our HDMI output endpoint on the A10 DTSI has a warning under DTC: "graph
node has single child node 'endpoint', #address-cells/#size-cells are not
necessary". Fix this by removing those properties.
