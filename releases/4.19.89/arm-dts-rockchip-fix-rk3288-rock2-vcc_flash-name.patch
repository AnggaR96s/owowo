Subject: ARM: dts: rockchip: Fix rk3288-rock2 vcc_flash name

From: John Keeping <john@metanate.com>

[ Upstream commit 03d9f8fa2bfdc791865624d3adc29070cf67814e ]

There is no functional change from this, but it is confusing to find two
copies of vcc_sys and no vcc_flash when looking in
/sys/class/regulator/*/name.
