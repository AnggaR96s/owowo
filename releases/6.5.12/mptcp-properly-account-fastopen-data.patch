Subject: mptcp: properly account fastopen data

From: Paolo Abeni <pabeni@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit bf0e96108fb6707613dd055aff5e98b02b99bb14 ]

Currently the socket level counter aggregating the received data
does not take in account the data received via fastopen.

Address the issue updating the counter as required.

Fixes: 38967f424b5b ("mptcp: track some aggregate data counters")
