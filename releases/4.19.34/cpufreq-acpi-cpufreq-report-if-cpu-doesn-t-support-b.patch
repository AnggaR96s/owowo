Subject: cpufreq: acpi-cpufreq: Report if CPU doesn't support boost
 technologies

[ Upstream commit 1222d527f314c86a3b59a522115d62facc5a7965 ]

There is some rare cases where CPB (and possibly IDA) are missing on
processors.

This is the case fixed by commit f7f3dc00f612 ("x86/cpu/AMD: Fix
erratum 1076 (CPB bit)") and following.

In such context, the boost status isn't reported by
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost.

This commit is about printing a message to report that the CPU
doesn't expose the boost capabilities.

This message could help debugging platforms hit by this phenomena.
