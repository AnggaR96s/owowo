Subject: soundwire: qcom: check for outanding writes before doing a read

From: Srinivas Kandagatla <srinivas.kandagatla@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 49a467310dc4fae591a3547860ee04d8730780f4 ]

Reading will increase the fifo count, so check for outstanding cmd wrt.
write fifo depth to avoid overflow as read will also increase
write fifo cnt.

Fixes: a661308c34de ("soundwire: qcom: wait for fifo space to be available before read/write")
