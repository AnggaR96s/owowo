Subject: iavf: do not override the adapter state in the watchdog task (again)

From: Stefan Assmann <sassmann@kpanic.de>

commit fe523d7c9a8332855376ad5eb1aa301091129ba4 upstream.

The watchdog task incorrectly changes the state to __IAVF_RESETTING,
instead of letting the reset task take care of that. This was already
resolved by commit 22c8fd71d3a5 ("iavf: do not override the adapter
state in the watchdog task") but the problem was reintroduced by the
recent code refactoring in commit 45eebd62999d ("iavf: Refactor iavf
state machine tracking").

Fixes: 45eebd62999d ("iavf: Refactor iavf state machine tracking")
