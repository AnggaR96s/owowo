Subject: ext4: reject the 'commit' option on ext2 filesystems

From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

[ Upstream commit cb8435dc8ba33bcafa41cf2aa253794320a3b8df ]

The 'commit' option is only applicable for ext3 and ext4 filesystems,
and has never been accepted by the ext2 filesystem driver, so the ext4
driver shouldn't allow it on ext2 filesystems.

This fixes a failure in xfstest ext4/053.

Fixes: 8dc0aa8cf0f7 ("ext4: check incompatible mount options while mounting ext2/3")
