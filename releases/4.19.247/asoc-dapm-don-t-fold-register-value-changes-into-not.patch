Subject: ASoC: dapm: Don't fold register value changes into notifications

From: Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit ad685980469b9f9b99d4d6ea05f4cb8f57cb2234 ]

DAPM tracks and reports the value presented to the user from DAPM controls
separately to the register value, these may diverge during initialisation
or when an autodisable control is in use.

When writing DAPM controls we currently report that a change has occurred
if either the DAPM value or the value stored in the register has changed,
meaning that if the two are out of sync we may appear to report a spurious
event to userspace. Since we use this folded in value for nothing other
than the value reported to userspace simply drop the folding in of the
register change.
