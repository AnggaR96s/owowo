Subject: btrfs: locking: remove the recursion handling code

From: Josef Bacik <josef@toxicpanda.com>

[ Upstream commit 4048daedb910f83f080c6bb03c78af794aebdff5 ]

Now that we're no longer using recursion, rip out all of the supporting
code.  Follow up patches will clean up the callers of these functions.

The extent_buffer::lock_owner is still retained as it allows safety
checks in btrfs_init_new_buffer for the case that the free space cache
is corrupted and we try to allocate a block that we are currently using
and have locked in the path.
