Subject: riscv: fix accessing 8-byte variable from RV32

[ Upstream commit dbee9c9c45846f003ec2f819710c2f4835630a6a ]

A memory save operation to 8-byte variable in RV32 is divided into
two sw instructions in the put_user macro.  The current fixup returns
execution flow to the second sw instead of the one after it.

This patch fixes this fixup code according to the load access part.
