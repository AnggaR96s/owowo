Subject: ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Revert "Fix DMIC map headsetmic mapping"

From: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

commit aee48a9ffa5a128bf4e433c57c39e015ea5b0208 upstream.

Commit 37c7401e8c1f ("ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Fix DMIC map
headsetmic mapping"), changed the headsetmic mapping from IN3P to IN2P,
this was based on the observation that all bytcr_rt5651 devices I have
access to (7 devices) where all using IN3P for the headsetmic. This was
an attempt to unifify / simplify the mapping, but it was wrong.

None of those devices was actually using a digital internal mic. Now I've
access to a Point of View TAB-P1006W-232 (v1.0) tabler, which does use a
DMIC and it does have its headsetmic connected to IN2P, showing that the
original mapping was correct, so this commit reverts the change changing
the mapping back to IN2P.
