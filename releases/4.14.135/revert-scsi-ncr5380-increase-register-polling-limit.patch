Subject: Revert "scsi: ncr5380: Increase register polling limit"

From: Finn Thain <fthain@telegraphics.com.au>

commit 25fcf94a2fa89dd3e73e965ebb0b38a2a4f72aa4 upstream.

This reverts commit 4822827a69d7cd3bc5a07b7637484ebd2cf88db6.

The purpose of that commit was to suppress a timeout warning message which
appeared to be caused by target latency. But suppressing the warning is
undesirable as the warning may indicate a messed up transfer count.

Another problem with that commit is that 15 ms is too long to keep
interrupts disabled as interrupt latency can cause system clock drift and
other problems.
