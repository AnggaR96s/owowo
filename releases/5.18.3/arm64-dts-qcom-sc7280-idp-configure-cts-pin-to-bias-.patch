Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280-idp: Configure CTS pin to bias-bus-hold for
 bluetooth

From: Vijaya Krishna Nivarthi <quic_vnivarth@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit 497b272759986af1aa5a25b5e903d082c67bd8f6 ]

WLAN rail was leaking power during RBSC/sleep even after turning BT off.
Change active and sleep pinctrl configurations to handle same.
