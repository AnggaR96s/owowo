Subject: drivers/perf: riscv: Disable PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_* while not supported

From: Pu Lehui <pulehui@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit ea6873118493019474abbf57d5a800da365734df ]

RISC-V perf driver does not yet support branch sampling. Although the
specification is in the works [0], it is best to disable such events
until support is available, otherwise we will get unexpected results.
Due to this reason, two riscv bpf testcases get_branch_snapshot and
perf_branches/perf_branches_hw fail.
