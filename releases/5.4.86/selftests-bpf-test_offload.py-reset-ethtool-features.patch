Subject: selftests/bpf/test_offload.py: Reset ethtool features after failed
 setting

[ Upstream commit 766e62b7fcd2cf1d43e6594ba37c659dc48f7ddb ]

When setting the ethtool feature flag fails (as expected for the test), the
kernel now tracks that the feature was requested to be 'off' and refuses to
subsequently disable it again. So reset it back to 'on' so a subsequent
disable (that's not supposed to fail) can succeed.
