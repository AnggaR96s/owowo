Subject: arm: dts: dra76x: Fix mmc3 max-frequency

From: Faiz Abbas <faiz_abbas@ti.com>

commit fa63c0039787b8fbacf4d6a51e3ff44288f5b90b upstream.

dra76x is not affected by i887 which requires mmc3 node to be limited to
a max frequency of 64 MHz. Fix this by overwriting the correct value in
the the dra76 specific dtsi.
