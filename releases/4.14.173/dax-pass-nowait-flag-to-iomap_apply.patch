Subject: dax: pass NOWAIT flag to iomap_apply

From: Jeff Moyer <jmoyer@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 96222d53842dfe54869ec4e1b9d4856daf9105a2 ]

fstests generic/471 reports a failure when run with MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o
dax".  The reason is that the initial pwrite to an empty file with the
RWF_NOWAIT flag set does not return -EAGAIN.  It turns out that
dax_iomap_rw doesn't pass that flag through to iomap_apply.

With this patch applied, generic/471 passes for me.
