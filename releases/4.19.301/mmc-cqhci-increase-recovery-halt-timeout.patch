Subject: mmc: cqhci: Increase recovery halt timeout

From: Adrian Hunter <adrian.hunter@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit b578d5d18e929aa7c007a98cce32657145dde219 ]

Failing to halt complicates the recovery. Additionally, unless the card or
controller are stuck, which is expected to be very rare, then the halt
should succeed, so it is better to wait. Set a large timeout.
