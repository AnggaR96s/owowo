Subject: HID: core: store the unique system identifier in hid_device

From: Benjamin Tissoires <benjamin.tissoires@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 1e839143d674603b0bbbc4c513bca35404967dbc ]

This unique identifier is currently used only for ensuring uniqueness in
sysfs. However, this could be handful for userspace to refer to a specific
hid_device by this id.

2 use cases are in my mind: LEDs (and their naming convention), and
HID-BPF.
