Subject: ARM: dts: imx6dl-riotboard: configure PHY clock and set proper EEE
 value

From: Oleksij Rempel <o.rempel@pengutronix.de>

[ Upstream commit 723de6a4126b2474a8106e943749e1554012dad6 ]

Without SoC specific PHY fixups the network interface on this board will
fail to work. Provide missing DT properties to make it work again.
