Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: fix pinctrl sleep nodename for rk3399.dtsi

From: Johan Jonker <jbx6244@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit a7ecfad495f8af63a5cb332c91f60ab2018897f5 ]

A test with the command below aimed at powerpc generates
notifications in the Rockchip arm64 tree.

Fix pinctrl "sleep" nodename by renaming it to "suspend"
for rk3399.dtsi

make ARCH=arm64 dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/powerpc/sleep.yaml
