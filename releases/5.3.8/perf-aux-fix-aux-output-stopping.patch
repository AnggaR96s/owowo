Subject: perf/aux: Fix AUX output stopping

From: Alexander Shishkin <alexander.shishkin@linux.intel.com>

commit f3a519e4add93b7b31a6616f0b09635ff2e6a159 upstream.

Commit:

  8a58ddae2379 ("perf/core: Fix exclusive events' grouping")

allows CAP_EXCLUSIVE events to be grouped with other events. Since all
of those also happen to be AUX events (which is not the case the other
way around, because arch/s390), this changes the rules for stopping the
output: the AUX event may not be on its PMU's context any more, if it's
grouped with a HW event, in which case it will be on that HW event's
context instead. If that's the case, munmap() of the AUX buffer can't
find and stop the AUX event, potentially leaving the last reference with
the atomic context, which will then end up freeing the AUX buffer. This
will then trip warnings:

Fix this by using the context's PMU context when looking for events
to stop, instead of the event's PMU context.
