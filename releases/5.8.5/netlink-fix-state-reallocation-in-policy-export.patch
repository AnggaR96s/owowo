Subject: netlink: fix state reallocation in policy export

From: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit d1fb55592909ea249af70170c7a52e637009564d ]

Evidently, when I did this previously, we didn't have more than
10 policies and didn't run into the reallocation path, because
it's missing a memset() for the unused policies. Fix that.

Fixes: d07dcf9aadd6 ("netlink: add infrastructure to expose policies to userspace")
