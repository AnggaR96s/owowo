Subject: btrfs: don't attempt to trim devices that don't support it

From: Jeff Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com>

commit 0be88e367fd8fbdb45257615d691f4675dda062f upstream.

We check whether any device the file system is using supports discard in
the ioctl call, but then we attempt to trim free extents on every device
regardless of whether discard is supported.  Due to the way we mask off
EOPNOTSUPP, we can end up issuing the trim operations on each free range
on devices that don't support it, just wasting time.
