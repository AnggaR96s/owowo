Subject: ARM: dts: rockchip: Fix the spi controller on rk3036

From: Heiko Stuebner <heiko@sntech.de>

[ Upstream commit 8bade1ad1f0821aef31f6a8fb1027ae292566d85 ]

Compatible and clock names did not match the existing binding.
So set the correct values and re-order+rename the clocks.

It looks like no rk3036 board did use the spi controller so far,
so this was never detected on a running device yet.

Fixes: f629fcfab2cd ("ARM: dts: rockchip: support the spi for rk3036")
