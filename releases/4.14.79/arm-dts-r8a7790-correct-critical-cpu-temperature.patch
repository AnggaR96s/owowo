Subject: ARM: dts: r8a7790: Correct critical CPU temperature
MIME-Version: 1.0

commit fcab5651fae4258a993170b7aaf443adbd3d4d84 upstream

The R-Car H2 hardware manual states that Tc = –40°C to +105°C. The
thermal sensor has an accuracy of ±5°C and there can be a temperature
difference of 1 or 2 degrees between Tjmax and the thermal sensor due
to the location of the latter.

This means that 95°C is a safer value to use.
