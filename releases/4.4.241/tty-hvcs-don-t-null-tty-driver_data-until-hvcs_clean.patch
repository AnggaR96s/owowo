Subject: tty: hvcs: Don't NULL tty->driver_data until hvcs_cleanup()

From: Tyrel Datwyler <tyreld@linux.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit 63ffcbdad738e3d1c857027789a2273df3337624 ]

The code currently NULLs tty->driver_data in hvcs_close() with the
intent of informing the next call to hvcs_open() that device needs to be
reconfigured. However, when hvcs_cleanup() is called we copy hvcsd from
tty->driver_data which was previoulsy NULLed by hvcs_close() and our
call to tty_port_put(&hvcsd->port) doesn't actually do anything since
&hvcsd->port ends up translating to NULL by chance. This has the side
effect that when hvcs_remove() is called we have one too many port
references preventing hvcs_destuct_port() from ever being called. This
also prevents us from reusing the /dev/hvcsX node in a future
hvcs_probe() and we can eventually run out of /dev/hvcsX devices.

Fix this by waiting to NULL tty->driver_data in hvcs_cleanup().
