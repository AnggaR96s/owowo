Subject: lib/strscpy: Shut up KASAN false-positives in strscpy()

From: Andrey Ryabinin <aryabinin@virtuozzo.com>

commit 1a3241ff10d038ecd096d03380327f2a0b5840a6 upstream.

strscpy() performs the word-at-a-time optimistic reads.  So it may may
access the memory past the end of the object, which is perfectly fine
since strscpy() doesn't use that (past-the-end) data and makes sure the
optimistic read won't cross a page boundary.

Use new read_word_at_a_time() to shut up the KASAN.

Note that this potentially could hide some bugs.  In example bellow,
stscpy() will copy more than we should (1-3 extra uninitialized bytes):

        char dst[8];
        char *src;

        src = kmalloc(5, GFP_KERNEL);
        memset(src, 0xff, 5);
        strscpy(dst, src, 8);
