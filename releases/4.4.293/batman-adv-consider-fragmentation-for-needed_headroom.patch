Subject: batman-adv: Consider fragmentation for needed_headroom
To: stable@vger.kernel.org
Cc: b.a.t.m.a.n@lists.open-mesh.org, "Sven Eckelmann" <sven@narfation.org>, "Linus Lüssing" <linus.luessing@c0d3.blue>, "Simon Wunderlich" <sw@simonwunderlich.de>
Message-ID: <20211120123939.260723-9-sven@narfation.org>

From: Sven Eckelmann <sven@narfation.org>

commit 4ca23e2c2074465bff55ea14221175fecdf63c5f upstream.

If a batman-adv packets has to be fragmented, then the original batman-adv
packet header is not stripped away. Instead, only a new header is added in
front of the packet after it was split.

This size must be considered to avoid cost intensive reallocations during
the transmission through the various device layers.

Fixes: 7bca68c7844b ("batman-adv: Add lower layer needed_(head|tail)room to own ones")
