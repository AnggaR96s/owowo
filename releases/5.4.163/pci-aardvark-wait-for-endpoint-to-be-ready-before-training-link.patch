commit f4c7d053d7f77cd5c1a1ba7c7ce085ddba13d1d7 upstream.

When configuring pcie reset pin from gpio (e.g. initially set by
u-boot) to pcie function this pin goes low for a brief moment
asserting the PERST# signal. Thus connected device enters fundamental
reset process and link configuration can only begin after a minimal
100ms delay (see [1]).

Because the pin configuration comes from the "default" pinctrl it is
implicitly configured before the probe callback is called:

driver_probe_device()
  really_probe()
    ...
    pinctrl_bind_pins() /* Here pin goes from gpio to PCIE reset
                           function and PERST# is asserted */
    ...
    drv->probe()
