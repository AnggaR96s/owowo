Subject: btrfs: properly report 0 avail for very full file systems

From: Josef Bacik <josef@toxicpanda.com>

commit 58bfe2ccec5f9f137b41dd38f335290dcc13cd5c upstream.

A user reported some issues with smaller file systems that get very
full.  While investigating this issue I noticed that df wasn't showing
100% full, despite having 0 chunk space and having < 1MiB of available
metadata space.

This turns out to be an overflow issue, we're doing:

  total_available_metadata_space - SZ_4M < global_block_rsv_size

to determine if there's not enough space to make metadata allocations,
which overflows if total_available_metadata_space is < 4M.  Fix this by
checking to see if our available space is greater than the 4M threshold.
This makes df properly report 100% usage on the file system.
