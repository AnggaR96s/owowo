Subject: perf report: Fix condition in sort__sym_cmp()

From: Namhyung Kim <namhyung@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit cb39d05e67dc24985ff9f5150e71040fa4d60ab8 ]

It's expected that both hist entries are in the same hists when
comparing two.  But the current code in the function checks one without
dso sort key and other with the key.  This would make the condition true
in any case.

I guess the intention of the original commit was to add '!' for the
right side too.  But as it should be the same, let's just remove it.
