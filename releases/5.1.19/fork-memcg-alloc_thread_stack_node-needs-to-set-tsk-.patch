Subject: fork,memcg: alloc_thread_stack_node needs to set tsk->stack

[ Upstream commit 1bf4580e00a248a2c86269125390eb3648e1877c ]

Commit 5eed6f1dff87 ("fork,memcg: fix crash in free_thread_stack on
memcg charge fail") corrected two instances, but there was a third
instance of this bug.

Without setting tsk->stack, if memcg_charge_kernel_stack fails, it'll
execute free_thread_stack() on a dangling pointer.

Enterprise kernels are compiled with VMAP_STACK=y so this isn't
critical, but custom VMAP_STACK=n builds should have some performance
advantage, with the drawback of risking to fail fork because compaction
didn't succeed.  So as long as VMAP_STACK=n is a supported option it's
worth fixing it upstream.
