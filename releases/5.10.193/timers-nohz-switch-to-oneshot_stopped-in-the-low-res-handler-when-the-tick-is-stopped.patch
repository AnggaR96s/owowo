Subject: timers/nohz: Switch to ONESHOT_STOPPED in the low-res handler when the tick is stopped

From: Nicholas Piggin <npiggin@gmail.com>

commit 62c1256d544747b38e77ca9b5bfe3a26f9592576 upstream.

When tick_nohz_stop_tick() stops the tick and high resolution timers are
disabled, then the clock event device is not put into ONESHOT_STOPPED
mode. This can lead to spurious timer interrupts with some clock event
device drivers that don't shut down entirely after firing.

Eliminate these by putting the device into ONESHOT_STOPPED mode at points
where it is not being reprogrammed. When there are no timers active, then
tick_program_event() with KTIME_MAX can be used to stop the device. When
there is a timer active, the device can be stopped at the next tick (any
new timer added by timers will reprogram the tick).
