Subject: vsock: prevent unnecessary refcnt inc for nonblocking connect

From: Eiichi Tsukata <eiichi.tsukata@nutanix.com>

[ Upstream commit c7cd82b90599fa10915f41e3dd9098a77d0aa7b6 ]

Currently vosck_connect() increments sock refcount for nonblocking
socket each time it's called, which can lead to memory leak if
it's called multiple times because connect timeout function decrements
sock refcount only once.

Fixes it by making vsock_connect() return -EALREADY immediately when
sock state is already SS_CONNECTING.

Fixes: d021c344051a ("VSOCK: Introduce VM Sockets")
