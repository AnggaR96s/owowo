Subject: i2c: brcmstb: Fix brcmstd_send_i2c_cmd condition

From: Maxime Ripard <maxime@cerno.tech>

[ Upstream commit a1858ce0cfe31368b23ba55794e409fb57ced4a4 ]

The brcmstb_send_i2c_cmd currently has a condition that is (CMD_RD ||
CMD_WR) which always evaluates to true, while the obvious fix is to test
whether the cmd variable passed as parameter holds one of these two
values.
