Subject: 9p: explicitly deny setlease attempts

From: Jeff Layton <jlayton@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 7a84602297d36617dbdadeba55a2567031e5165b ]

9p is a remote network protocol, and it doesn't support asynchronous
notifications from the server. Ensure that we don't hand out any leases
since we can't guarantee they'll be broken when a file's contents
change.
