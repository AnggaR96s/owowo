Subject: net: bcmgenet: synchronize EXT_RGMII_OOB_CTRL access

From: Doug Berger <opendmb@gmail.com>

commit d85cf67a339685beae1d0aee27b7f61da95455be upstream.

The EXT_RGMII_OOB_CTRL register can be written from different
contexts. It is predominantly written from the adjust_link
handler which is synchronized by the phydev->lock, but can
also be written from a different context when configuring the
mii in bcmgenet_mii_config().

The chances of contention are quite low, but it is conceivable
that adjust_link could occur during resume when WoL is enabled
so use the phydev->lock synchronizer in bcmgenet_mii_config()
to be sure.
