Subject: mtd: parsers: ofpart: add workaround for #size-cells 0

From: Francesco Dolcini <francesco.dolcini@toradex.com>

commit 84549c816dc317f012798e706e58669b3b013604 upstream.

Add a mechanism to handle the case in which partitions are present as
direct child of the nand controller node and #size-cells is set to <0>.

This could happen if the nand-controller node in the DTS is supposed to
have #size-cells set to 0, but for some historical reason/bug it was set
to 1 in the past, and the firmware (e.g. U-Boot) is adding the partition
as direct children of the nand-controller defaulting to #size-cells
being to 1.

This prevents a real boot failure on colibri-imx7 that happened during v6.1
development cycles.
