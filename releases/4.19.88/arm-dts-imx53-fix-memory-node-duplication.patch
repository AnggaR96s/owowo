Subject: ARM: dts: imx53: Fix memory node duplication

From: Fabio Estevam <festevam@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit e8fd17b900a4a1e3a8bef7b44727cbad35db05a7 ]

Boards based on imx53 have duplicate memory nodes:

- One coming from the board dts file: memory@

- One coming from the imx53.dtsi file.

Fix the duplication by removing the memory node from the dtsi file
and by adding 'device_type = "memory";' in the board dts.
