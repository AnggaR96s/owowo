Subject: ARM: dts: imx35: Fix memory node duplication

From: Fabio Estevam <festevam@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 8721610a6c2b8c42fc57819d8c3bfbb9166f95a3 ]

Boards based on imx35 have duplicate memory nodes:

- One coming from the board dts file: memory@

- One coming from the imx35.dtsi file.

Fix the duplication by removing the memory node from the dtsi file
and by adding 'device_type = "memory";' in the board dts.
