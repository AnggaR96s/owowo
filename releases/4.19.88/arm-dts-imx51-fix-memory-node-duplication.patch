Subject: ARM: dts: imx51: Fix memory node duplication

From: Fabio Estevam <festevam@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 6a9681168b83c62abfa457c709f2f4b126bd6b92 ]

Boards based on imx51 have duplicate memory nodes:

- One coming from the board dts file: memory@

- One coming from the imx51.dtsi file.

Fix the duplication by removing the memory node from the dtsi file
and by adding 'device_type = "memory";' in the board dts.
