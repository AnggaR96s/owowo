Subject: ARM: dts: Fix hsi gdd range for omap4

From: Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>

[ Upstream commit e9e685480b74aef3f3d0967dadb52eea3ff625d2 ]

While reviewing the missing mcasp ranges I noticed omap4 hsi range
for gdd is wrong so let's fix it.

I'm not aware of any omap4 devices in mainline kernel though that use
hsi though.

Fixes: 84badc5ec5fc ("ARM: dts: omap4: Move l4 child devices to probe
them with ti-sysc")
