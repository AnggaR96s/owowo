Subject: drm/msm/dpu: correct clk bit for WB2 block

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit e843ca2f30e630675e2d2a75c96f4844f2854430 ]

On sc7280 there are two clk bits for WB2: vbif_cli and clk_ctrl. While
programming the VBIF params of WB, the driver should be toggling the
former bit, while the sc7180_mdp, sc7280_mdp and sm8250_mdp structs
list the latter one.

Correct that to ensure proper programming sequence for WB2 on these
platforms.

Fixes: 255f056181ac ("drm/msm/dpu: sc7180: add missing WB2 clock control")
Fixes: 3ce166380567 ("drm/msm/dpu: add writeback support for sc7280")
Fixes: 53324b99bd7b ("drm/msm/dpu: add writeback blocks to the sm8250 DPU catalog")
