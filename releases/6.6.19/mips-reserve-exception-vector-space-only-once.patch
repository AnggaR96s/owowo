Subject: MIPS: reserve exception vector space ONLY ONCE

From: Huang Pei <huangpei@loongson.cn>

[ Upstream commit abcabb9e30a1f9a69c76776f8abffc31c377b542 ]

"cpu_probe" is called both by BP and APs, but reserving exception vector
(like 0x0-0x1000) called by "cpu_probe" need once and calling on APs is
too late since memblock is unavailable at that time.

So, reserve exception vector ONLY by BP.
