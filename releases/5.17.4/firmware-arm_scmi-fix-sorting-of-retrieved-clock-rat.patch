Subject: firmware: arm_scmi: Fix sorting of retrieved clock rates

From: Cristian Marussi <cristian.marussi@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit 23274739a5b6166f74d8d9cb5243d7bf6b46aab9 ]

During SCMI Clock protocol initialization, after having retrieved from the
SCMI platform all the available discrete rates for a specific clock, the
clock rates array is sorted, unfortunately using a pointer to its end as
a base instead of its start, so that sorting does not work.

Fix invocation of sort() passing as base a pointer to the start of the
retrieved clock rates array.
