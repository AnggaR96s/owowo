Subject: Revert "posix-cpu-timers: Force next expiration recalc after
 itimer reset"

From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

This reverts commit c322a963d522e9a4273e18c9d7bd6fd40a25160f which is
commit 406dd42bd1ba0c01babf9cde169bb319e52f6147 upstream.

It is reported to cause regressions.  A proposed fix has been posted,
but it is not in a released kernel yet.  So just revert this from the
stable release so that the bug is fixed.  If it's really needed we can
add it back in in a future release.
