Subject: ASoC: wm_adsp: Don't generate kcontrols without READ flags

From: Stuart Henderson <stuarth@opensource.cirrus.com>

[ Upstream commit 3ae7359c0e39f42a96284d6798fc669acff38140 ]

User space always expects to be able to read ALSA controls, so ensure
no kcontrols are generated without an appropriate READ flag. In the case
of a read of such a control zeros will be returned.
