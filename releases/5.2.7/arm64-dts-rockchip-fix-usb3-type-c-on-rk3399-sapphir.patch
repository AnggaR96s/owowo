Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix USB3 Type-C on rk3399-sapphire

[ Upstream commit e1d9149e8389f1690cdd4e4056766dd26488a0fe ]

Before this patch, the Type-C port on the Sapphire board is dead.
If setting the 'regulator-always-on' property to 'vcc5v0_typec0'
then the port works for about 4 seconds at start-up. This is a
sample trace with a memory stick plugged in:
1.- The memory stick LED lights on and kernel reports:
[    4.782999] scsi 0:0:0:0: Direct-Access USB DISK PMAP PQ: 0 ANSI: 4
[    5.904580] sd 0:0:0:0: [sdb] 3913344 512-byte logical blocks: (2.00 GB/1.87 GiB)
[    5.906860] sd 0:0:0:0: [sdb] Write Protect is off
[    5.908973] sd 0:0:0:0: [sdb] Mode Sense: 23 00 00 00
[    5.909122] sd 0:0:0:0: [sdb] No Caching mode page found
[    5.911214] sd 0:0:0:0: [sdb] Assuming drive cache: write through
[    5.951585]  sdb: sdb1
[    5.954816] sd 0:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk
2.- 4 seconds later the memory stick LED lights off and kernel reports:
[    9.082822] phy phy-ff770000.syscon:usb2-phy@e450.2: charger = USB_DCP_CHARGER
3.- After a minute the kernel reports:
[   71.666761] usb 5-1: USB disconnect, device number 2
It has been checked that, although the LED is off, VBUS is present.

If, instead, the dr_mode is changed to host and the phy-supply changed
accordingly, then it works. It has only been tested in host mode.
