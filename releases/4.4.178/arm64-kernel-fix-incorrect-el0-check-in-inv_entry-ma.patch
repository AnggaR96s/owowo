Subject: arm64/kernel: fix incorrect EL0 check in inv_entry macro

[ Upstream commit b660950c60a7278f9d8deb7c32a162031207c758 ]

The implementation of macro inv_entry refers to its 'el' argument without
the required leading backslash, which results in an undefined symbol
'el' to be passed into the kernel_entry macro rather than the index of
the exception level as intended.

This undefined symbol strangely enough does not result in build failures,
although it is visible in vmlinux:

     $ nm -n vmlinux |head
                      U el
     0000000000000000 A _kernel_flags_le_hi32
     0000000000000000 A _kernel_offset_le_hi32
     0000000000000000 A _kernel_size_le_hi32
     000000000000000a A _kernel_flags_le_lo32
     .....

However, it does result in incorrect code being generated for invalid
exceptions taken from EL0, since the argument check in kernel_entry
assumes EL1 if its argument does not equal '0'.
