Subject: i2c: Prevent runtime suspend of adapter when Host Notify is required

From: Jarkko Nikula <jarkko.nikula@linux.intel.com>

commit 72bfcee11cf89509795c56b0e40a3785ab00bbdd upstream.

Multiple users have reported their Synaptics touchpad has stopped
working between v4.20.1 and v4.20.2 when using SMBus interface.

The culprit for this appeared to be commit c5eb1190074c ("PCI / PM: Allow
runtime PM without callback functions") that fixed the runtime PM for
i2c-i801 SMBus adapter. Those Synaptics touchpad are using i2c-i801
for SMBus communication and testing showed they are able to get back
working by preventing the runtime suspend of adapter.

Normally when i2c-i801 SMBus adapter transmits with the client it resumes
before operation and autosuspends after.

However, if client requires SMBus Host Notify protocol, what those
Synaptics touchpads do, then the host adapter must not go to runtime
suspend since then it cannot process incoming SMBus Host Notify commands
the client may send.

Fix this by keeping I2C/SMBus adapter active in case client requires
Host Notify.
