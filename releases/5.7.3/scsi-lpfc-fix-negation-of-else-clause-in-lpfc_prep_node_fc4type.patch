Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix negation of else clause in lpfc_prep_node_fc4type

From: Dick Kennedy <dick.kennedy@broadcom.com>

commit f809da6db68a8be49e317f0ccfbced1af9258839 upstream.

Implementation of a previous patch added a condition to an if check that
always end up with the if test being true. Execution of the else clause was
inadvertently negated.  The additional condition check was incorrect and
unnecessary after the other modifications had been done in that patch.

Remove the check from the if series.
