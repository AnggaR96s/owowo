Subject: ALSA: fireface: fix for state to fetch PCM frames

From: Takashi Sakamoto <o-takashi@sakamocchi.jp>

commit 3d16200a3e55a39caa1c88419cb559c00316f721 upstream.

According to my memo at hand and saved records, writing 0x00000001 to
SND_FF_REG_FETCH_PCM_FRAMES disables fetching PCM frames in corresponding
channel, however current implement uses reversed logic. This results in
muted volume in device side during playback.

This commit corrects the bug.
