Subject: net: ipv6: fix returned variable type in ip6_skb_dst_mtu

From: Antoine Tenart <atenart@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 4039146777a91e1576da2bf38e0d8a1061a1ae47 ]

The patch fixing the returned value of ip6_skb_dst_mtu (int -> unsigned
int) was rebased between its initial review and the version applied. In
the meantime fade56410c22 was applied, which added a new variable (int)
used as the returned value. This lead to a mismatch between the function
prototype and the variable used as the return value.
