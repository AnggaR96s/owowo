Subject: arm64: dts: meson: add missing g12 rng clock

From: Scott K Logan <logans@cottsay.net>

[ Upstream commit a1afbbb0285797e01313779c71287d936d069245 ]

This adds the missing perpheral clock for the RNG for Amlogic G12. As
stated in amlogic,meson-rng.yaml, this isn't always necessary for the
RNG to function, but is better to have in case the clock is disabled for
some reason prior to loading.
