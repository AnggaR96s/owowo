Subject: Revert "coresight: Make sysfs functional on topologies with per core
 sink"

This reverts commit 8fd52a21ab570e80f84f39e12affce42a5300e91.

I get the following build warning in v5.4.75.

drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-etm-perf.c: In function 'etm_setup_aux':
drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-etm-perf.c:226:37: warning:
                        passing argument 1 of 'coresight_get_enabled_sink' makes pointer from integer without a cast

Actually, the warning is fatal, since the call is
        sink = coresight_get_enabled_sink(true);
However, the argument to coresight_get_enabled_sink() is now a pointer.
The parameter change was introduced with commit 8fd52a21ab57
("coresight: Make sysfs functional on topologies with per core sink").

In the upstream kernel, the call is removed with commit bb1860efc817
("coresight: etm: perf: Sink selection using sysfs is deprecated").
That commit alone would, however, likely not solve the problem.
It looks like at least two more commits would be needed.

716f5652a131 coresight: etm: perf: Fix warning caused by etm_setup_aux failure
8e264c52e1da coresight: core: Allow the coresight core driver to be built as a module
39a7661dcf65 coresight: Fix uninitialised pointer bug in etm_setup_aux()

Looking into the coresight code, I see several additional commits affecting
the sysfs interface since v5.4. I have no idea what would actually be needed
for stable code in v5.4.y, short of applying them all.

With all this in mind, I would suggest to revert commit 8fd52a21ab57
("coresight: Make sysfs functional on topologies with per core sink")
from v5.4.y, especially since it is not marked as bug fix or for stable.
