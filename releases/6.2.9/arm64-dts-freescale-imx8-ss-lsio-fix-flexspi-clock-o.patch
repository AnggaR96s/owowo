Subject: arm64: dts: freescale: imx8-ss-lsio: Fix flexspi clock order

From: Alexander Stein <alexander.stein@ew.tq-group.com>

[ Upstream commit fd4334a06d452ce89a0bb831b03130c51331d927 ]

The correct clock order is "fspi_en" and "fspi". As they are identical
just reordering the names is sufficient.

Fixes: 6276d66984e9 ("arm64: dts: imx8dxl: add flexspi0 support")
