Subject: vmstat: call fold_vm_zone_numa_events() before show per zone NUMA event

From: MengEn Sun <mengensun@tencent.com>

commit 2ea80b039b9af0b71c00378523b71c254fb99c23 upstream.

Since 5.14-rc1, NUMA events will only be folded from per-CPU statistics to
per zone and global statistics when the user actually needs it.

Currently, the kernel has performs the fold operation when reading
/proc/vmstat, but does not perform the fold operation in /proc/zoneinfo.
This can lead to inaccuracies in the following statistics in zoneinfo:
- numa_hit
- numa_miss
- numa_foreign
- numa_interleave
- numa_local
- numa_other

Therefore, before printing per-zone vm_numa_event when reading
/proc/zoneinfo, we should also perform the fold operation.
