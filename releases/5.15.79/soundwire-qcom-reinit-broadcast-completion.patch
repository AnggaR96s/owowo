Subject: soundwire: qcom: reinit broadcast completion

From: Srinivas Kandagatla <srinivas.kandagatla@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit f936fa7a954b262cb3908bbc8f01ba19dfaf9fbf ]

For some reason we never reinit the broadcast completion, there is a
danger that broadcast commands could be treated as completed by driver
from previous complete status.
Fix this by reinitializing the completion before sending a broadcast command.

Fixes: ddea6cf7b619 ("soundwire: qcom: update register read/write routine")
