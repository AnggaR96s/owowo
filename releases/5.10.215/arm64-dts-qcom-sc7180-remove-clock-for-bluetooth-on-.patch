Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Remove clock for bluetooth on Trogdor

From: Venkata Lakshmi Narayana Gubba <gubbaven@codeaurora.org>

[ Upstream commit a307a9773420dc7d385991f61fbede2fe100bd78 ]

Removed voting for RPMH_RF_CLK2 which is not required as it is
getting managed by BT SoC through SW_CTRL line.
