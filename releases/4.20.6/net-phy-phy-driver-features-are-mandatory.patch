Subject: net: phy: phy driver features are mandatory

From: Camelia Groza <camelia.groza@nxp.com>

[ Upstream commit 3e64cf7a435ed0500e3adaa8aada2272d3ae8abc ]

Since phy driver features became a link_mode bitmap, phy drivers that
don't have a list of features configured will cause the kernel to crash
when probed.

Prevent the phy driver from registering if the features field is missing.

Fixes: 719655a14971 ("net: phy: Replace phy driver features u32 with link_mode bitmap")
