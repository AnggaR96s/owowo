Subject: ARM: dts: spear3xx: Fix gmac node

From: Herve Codina <herve.codina@bootlin.com>

[ Upstream commit 6636fec29cdf6665bd219564609e8651f6ddc142 ]

On SPEAr3xx, ethernet driver is not compatible with the SPEAr600
one.
Indeed, SPEAr3xx uses an earlier version of this IP (v3.40) and
needs some driver tuning compare to SPEAr600.

The v3.40 IP support was added to stmmac driver and this patch
fixes this issue and use the correct compatible string for
SPEAr3xx
