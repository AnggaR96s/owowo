Subject: wlcore/wl12xx: Fix wl12xx get_mac error if device is in ELP

From: Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>

[ Upstream commit 11ef6bc846dcdce838f0b00c5f6a562c57e5d43b ]

At least on wl12xx, reading the MAC after boot can fail with a warning
at drivers/net/wireless/ti/wlcore/sdio.c:78 wl12xx_sdio_raw_read.
The failed call comes from wl12xx_get_mac() that wlcore_nvs_cb() calls
after request_firmware_work_func().

After the error, no wireless interface is created. Reloading the wl12xx
module makes the interface work.

Turns out the wlan controller can be in a low-power ELP state after the
boot from the bootloader or kexec, and needs to be woken up first.

Let's wake the hardware and add a sleep after that similar to
wl12xx_pre_boot() is already doing.

Note that a similar issue could exist for wl18xx, but I have not seen it
so far. And a search for wl18xx_get_mac and wl12xx_sdio_raw_read did not
produce similar errors.
