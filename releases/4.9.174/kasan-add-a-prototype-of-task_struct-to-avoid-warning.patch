Subject: kasan: add a prototype of task_struct to avoid warning

From: Masami Hiramatsu <mhiramat@kernel.org>

commit 5be9b730b09c45c358bbfe7f51d254e306cccc07 upstream.

Add a prototype of task_struct to fix below warning on arm64.

  In file included from arch/arm64/kernel/probes/kprobes.c:19:0:
  include/linux/kasan.h:81:132: error: 'struct task_struct' declared inside parameter list will not be visible outside of this definition or declaration [-Werror]
   static inline void kasan_unpoison_task_stack(struct task_struct *task) {}

As same as other types (kmem_cache, page, and vm_struct) this adds a
prototype of task_struct data structure on top of kasan.h.

[arnd] A related warning was fixed before, but now appears in a
different line in the same file in v4.11-rc2.  The patch from Masami
Hiramatsu still seems appropriate, so let's take his version.
