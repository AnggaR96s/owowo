Subject: blk-mq: don't grab rq's refcount in blk_mq_check_expired()

From: Ming Lei <ming.lei@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit c797b40ccc340b8a66f7a7842aecc90bf749f087 ]

Inside blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter() we already grabbed request's
refcount before calling ->fn(), so needn't to grab it one more time
in blk_mq_check_expired().

Meantime remove extra request expire check in blk_mq_check_expired().
