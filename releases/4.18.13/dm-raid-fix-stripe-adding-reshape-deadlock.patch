Subject: dm raid: fix stripe adding reshape deadlock

From: Heinz Mauelshagen <heinzm@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 644e2537fdc77baeeefc829524937bca64329f82 ]

When initiating a stripe adding reshape, a deadlock between
md_stop_writes() waiting for the sync thread to stop and the running
sync thread waiting for inactive stripes occurs (this frequently happens
on single-core but rarely on multi-core systems).

Fix this deadlock by setting MD_RECOVERY_WAIT to have the main MD
resynchronization thread worker (md_do_sync()) bail out when initiating
the reshape via constructor arguments.
