Subject: atm: solos-pci: Fix potential deadlock on &cli_queue_lock

From: Chengfeng Ye <dg573847474@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit d5dba32b8f6cb39be708b726044ba30dbc088b30 ]

As &card->cli_queue_lock is acquired under softirq context along the
following call chain from solos_bh(), other acquisition of the same
lock inside process context should disable at least bh to avoid double
lock.

<deadlock #1>
console_show()
--> spin_lock(&card->cli_queue_lock)
<interrupt>
   --> solos_bh()
   --> spin_lock(&card->cli_queue_lock)

This flaw was found by an experimental static analysis tool I am
developing for irq-related deadlock.

To prevent the potential deadlock, the patch uses spin_lock_bh()
on the card->cli_queue_lock under process context code consistently
to prevent the possible deadlock scenario.

Fixes: 9c54004ea717 ("atm: Driver for Solos PCI ADSL2+ card.")
