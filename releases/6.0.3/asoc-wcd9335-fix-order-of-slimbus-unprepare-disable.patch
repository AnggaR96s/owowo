Subject: ASoC: wcd9335: fix order of Slimbus unprepare/disable

From: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>

commit ea8ef003aa53ad23e7705c5cab1c4e664faa6c79 upstream.

Slimbus streams are first prepared and then enabled, so the cleanup path
should reverse it.  The unprepare sets stream->num_ports to 0 and frees
the stream->ports.  Calling disable after unprepare was not really
effective (channels was not deactivated) and could lead to further
issues due to making transfers on unprepared stream.
