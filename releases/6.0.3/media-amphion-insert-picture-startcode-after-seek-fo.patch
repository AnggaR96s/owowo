Subject: media: amphion: insert picture startcode after seek for vc1g format

From: Ming Qian <ming.qian@nxp.com>

[ Upstream commit f7fd6c318c8a5d06bf3fe611f30763d62eaaf7f0 ]

For format vc1, the amphion vpu requires driver to
help insert some custom startcode before sequence and frame.
the startcode is different for vc1l and vc1g format.

But the sequence startcode is only needed at the beginning,
and it's not expected after seek.
driver need to treat the codec header and the first frame after seek
as a normal frame, and insert picture startcode for it.

In previous patch, I just fix it for vc1l format,
and should fix the similar issue for vc1g too.

Fixes: e670f5d672ef (media: amphion: only insert the first sequence startcode for vc1l format)
