Subject: mlxsw: spectrum: Don't count internal TX header bytes to stats

From: Nogah Frankel <nogahf@mellanox.com>

commit 63dcdd35c1552ca0c911e98ba3389a0729a457f4 upstream.

Stop the SW TX counter from counting the TX header bytes
since they are not being sent out.

Fixes: 56ade8fe3fe1 ("mlxsw: spectrum: Add initial support for Spectrum ASIC")
