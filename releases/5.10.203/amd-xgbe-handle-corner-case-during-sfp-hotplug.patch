Subject: amd-xgbe: handle corner-case during sfp hotplug

From: Raju Rangoju <Raju.Rangoju@amd.com>

[ Upstream commit 676ec53844cbdf2f47e68a076cdff7f0ec6cbe3f ]

Force the mode change for SFI in Fixed PHY configurations. Fixed PHY
configurations needs PLL to be enabled while doing mode set. When the
SFP module isn't connected during boot, driver assumes AN is ON and
attempts auto-negotiation. However, if the connected SFP comes up in
Fixed PHY configuration the link will not come up as PLL isn't enabled
while the initial mode set command is issued. So, force the mode change
for SFI in Fixed PHY configuration to fix link issues.
