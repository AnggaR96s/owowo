[ upstream commit c06c6c5d276707e04cedbcc55625e984922118aa ]

This is required for the failure case (io_req_complete_failed) and is
missing.

The alternative would be to only lock in the failure path, however all of
the non-error paths in io_poll_check_events that do not do not return
IOU_POLL_NO_ACTION end up locking anyway. The only extraneous lock would
be for the multishot poll overflowing the CQE ring, however multishot poll
would probably benefit from being locked as it will allow completions to
be batched.

So it seems reasonable to lock always.
