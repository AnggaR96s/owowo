Subject: selftests/powerpc: Fix "no_handler" EBB selftest

From: Athira Rajeev <atrajeev@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit 45677c9aebe926192e59475b35a1ff35ff2d4217 ]

The "no_handler_test" in ebb selftests attempts to read the PMU
registers twice via helper function "dump_ebb_state". First dump is
just before closing of event and the second invocation is done after
closing of the event. The original intention of second
dump_ebb_state was to dump the state of registers at the end of
the test when the counters are frozen. But this will be achieved
with the first call itself since sample period is set to low value
and PMU will be frozen by then. Hence patch removes the
dump which was done before closing of the event.
