Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: pmk8350: Use the correct PON compatible

From: Konrad Dybcio <konrad.dybcio@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit c0ee8e0ba5cc17623e63349a168b41e407b1eef0 ]

A special compatible was introduced for PMK8350 both in the driver and
the bindings to facilitate for 2 base registers (PBS & HLOS). Use it.
