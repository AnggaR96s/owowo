Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: pmk8350: Specify PBS register for PON

From: Konrad Dybcio <konrad.dybcio@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit f46ef374e0dcb8fd2f272a376cf0dcdab7e52fc2 ]

PMK8350 is the first PMIC to require both HLOS and PBS registers for
PON to function properly (at least in theory, sm8350 sees no change).
The support for it on the driver side has been added long ago,
but it has never been wired up. Do so.
