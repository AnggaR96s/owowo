Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: correct SPMI bus address cells

From: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 8da3786a91e56fe0c4aeb2c2209744474af6e517 ]

The SPMI bus uses two address cells and zero size cells (second reg
entry - SPMI_USID - is not the size):

  spmi@c440000: #address-cells:0:0: 2 was expected

Fixes: 14abf8dfe364 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: Add SPMI PMIC arbiter device for SC7280")
