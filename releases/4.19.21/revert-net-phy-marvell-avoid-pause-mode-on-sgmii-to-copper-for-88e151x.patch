Subject: Revert "net: phy: marvell: avoid pause mode on SGMII-to-Copper for 88e151x"

From: Russell King <rmk+kernel@armlinux.org.uk>

[ Upstream commit c14f07c6211cc01d52ed92cce1fade5071b8d197 ]

This reverts commit 6623c0fba10ef45b64ca213ad5dec926f37fa9a0.

The original diagnosis was incorrect: it appears that the NIC had
PHY polling mode enabled, which meant that it overwrote the PHYs
advertisement register during negotiation.
