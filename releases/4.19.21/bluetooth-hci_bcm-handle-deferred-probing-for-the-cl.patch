Subject: Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Handle deferred probing for the clock supply

[ Upstream commit 28ac03b9ac3f784c2f048a910c8d0a7a87483b66 ]

On some systems that actually have the bluetooth controller wired up
with an extra clock signal, it's possible the bluetooth controller
probes before the clock provider. clk_get would return a defer probe
error, which was not handled by this driver.

Handle this properly, so that these systems can work reliably.
