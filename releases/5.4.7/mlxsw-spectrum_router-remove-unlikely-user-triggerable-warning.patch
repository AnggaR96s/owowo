Subject: mlxsw: spectrum_router: Remove unlikely user-triggerable warning

From: Ido Schimmel <idosch@mellanox.com>

[ Upstream commit 62201c00c4679ad8f0730d6d925a5d23651dfad2 ]

In case the driver vetoes the addition of an IPv6 multipath route, the
IPv6 stack will emit delete notifications for the sibling routes that
were already added to the FIB trie. Since these siblings are not present
in hardware, a warning will be generated.

Have the driver ignore notifications for routes it does not have.

Fixes: ebee3cad835f ("ipv6: Add IPv6 multipath notifications for add / replace")
