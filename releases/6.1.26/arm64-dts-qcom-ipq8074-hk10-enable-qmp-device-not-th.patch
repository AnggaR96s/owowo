Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074-hk10: enable QMP device, not the PHY node

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 1dc40551f206d20b7e46ea7dd538dcdd928451c6 ]

Correct PCIe PHY enablement to refer the QMP device nodes rather than
PHY device nodes. QMP nodes have 'status = "disabled"' property in the
ipq8074.dtsi, while PHY nodes do not correspond to the actual device and
do not have the status property.
