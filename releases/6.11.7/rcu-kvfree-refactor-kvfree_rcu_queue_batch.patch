Subject: rcu/kvfree: Refactor kvfree_rcu_queue_batch()

From: Uladzislau Rezki (Sony) <urezki@gmail.com>

commit 3c5d61ae919cc377c71118ccc76fa6e8518023f8 upstream.

Improve readability of kvfree_rcu_queue_batch() function
in away that, after a first batch queuing, the loop is break
and success value is returned to a caller.

There is no reason to loop and check batches further as all
outstanding objects have already been picked and attached to
a certain batch to complete an offloading.

Fixes: 2b55d6a42d14 ("rcu/kvfree: Add kvfree_rcu_barrier() API")
Suggested-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Closes: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/ZvWUt2oyXRsvJRNc@pc636/T/
