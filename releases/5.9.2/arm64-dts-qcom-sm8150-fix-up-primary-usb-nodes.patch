Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sm8150: fix up primary USB nodes

From: Jonathan Marek <jonathan@marek.ca>

[ Upstream commit 79493db5bb573017767b4f48b0fc69bfd01b82d2 ]

The compatible for hsphy has out of place indentation, and the assigned
clock rate for GCC_USB30_PRIM_MASTER_CLK is incorrect, the clock doesn't
support a rate of 150000000. Use a rate of 200000000 to match downstream.

Fixes: b33d2868e8d3 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sm8150: Add USB and PHY device nodes")
