Subject: clk: qcom: Fix SM_GPUCC_8650 dependencies

From: Nathan Chancellor <nathan@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 07fb0a76bb757990b99fc2ab78ad7d1709cc441d ]

CONFIG_SM_GCC_8650 depends on ARM64 but it is selected by
CONFIG_SM_GPUCC_8650, which can be selected on ARM, resulting in a
Kconfig warning.

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SM_GCC_8650
  Depends on [n]: COMMON_CLK [=y] && COMMON_CLK_QCOM [=y] && (ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST [=n])
  Selected by [y]:
  - SM_GPUCC_8650 [=y] && COMMON_CLK [=y] && COMMON_CLK_QCOM [=y]

Add the same dependencies to CONFIG_SM_GPUCC_8650 to resolve the
warning.
