Subject: can: m_can: make custom bittiming fields const

From: Matthias Schiffer <matthias.schiffer@ew.tq-group.com>

commit ea22ba40debee29ee7257c42002409899e9311c1 upstream.

The assigned timing structs will be defined a const anyway, so we can
avoid a few casts by declaring the struct fields as const as well.
