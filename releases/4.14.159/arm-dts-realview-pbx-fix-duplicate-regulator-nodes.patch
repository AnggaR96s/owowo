Subject: ARM: dts: realview-pbx: Fix duplicate regulator nodes

From: Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 7f4b001b7f6e0480b5bdab9cd8ce1711e43e5cb5 ]

There's a bug in dtc in checking for duplicate node names when there's
another section (e.g. "/ { };"). In this case, skeleton.dtsi provides
another section. Upon removal of skeleton.dtsi, the dtb fails to build
due to a duplicate node 'fixedregulator@0'. As both nodes were pretty
much the same 3.3V fixed regulator, it hasn't really mattered. Fix this
by renaming the nodes to something unique. In the process, drop the
unit-address which shouldn't be present wtihout reg property.
