Subject: dlm: fix possible call to kfree() for non-initialized pointer

From: Denis V. Lunev <den@openvz.org>

[ Upstream commit 58a923adf4d9aca8bf7205985c9c8fc531c65d72 ]

Technically dlm_config_nodes() could return error and keep nodes
uninitialized. After that on the fail path of we'll call kfree()
for that uninitialized value.

The patch is simple - we should just initialize nodes with NULL.
