Subject: Documentation: KVM: fix warning in "make htmldocs"

From: Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com>

commit efbc6bd090f48ccf64f7a8dd5daea775821d57ec upstream.

The warning

 Documentation/virt/kvm/locking.rst:31: ERROR: Unexpected indentation.

is caused by incorrectly treating a line as the continuation of a paragraph,
rather than as the first line in a bullet list.

Fixed: 44d174596260 ("KVM: Use dedicated mutex to protect kvm_usage_count to avoid deadlock")
