Subject: KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add of_node_put() in success path

From: Nicholas Mc Guire <hofrat@osadl.org>

[ Upstream commit 51eaa08f029c7343df846325d7cf047be8b96e81 ]

The call to of_find_compatible_node() is returning a pointer with
incremented refcount so it must be explicitly decremented after the
last use. As here it is only being used for checking of node presence
but the result is not actually used in the success path it can be
dropped immediately.
