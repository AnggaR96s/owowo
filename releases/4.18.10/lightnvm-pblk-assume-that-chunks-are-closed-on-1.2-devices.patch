Subject: lightnvm: pblk: assume that chunks are closed on 1.2 devices

From: Hans Holmberg <hans.holmberg@cnexlabs.com>

[ Upstream commit f6352103d2e0ad2d2066725eb19bfdfb8763239b ]

We can't know if a block is closed or not on 1.2 devices, so assume
closed state to make sure that blocks are erased before writing.
