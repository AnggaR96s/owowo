Subject: ARM: dts: exynos: Fix regulators configuration on Peach Pi/Pit
 Chromebooks

From: Marek Szyprowski <m.szyprowski@samsung.com>

[ Upstream commit f8f3b7fc21b1cb59385b780acd9b9a26d04cb7b2 ]

Regulators, which are marked as 'on-in-suspend' seems to be critical for
board operation, thus they must not be disabled anytime. This can be
only assured by marking them as 'always-on', because otherwise some
actions of their clients might result in turning them off. This patch
restores suspend/resume operation on Peach-Pit Chromebook board. It
partially reverts 'always-on' property removal done by the commit
mentioned in the Fixes tag.

Fixes: 665c441eea3d ("ARM: dts: exynos: Remove unneded always-on for regulators on Peach boards")
