Subject: i2c: iop3xx: fix deferred probing

From: Sergey Shtylyov <s.shtylyov@omp.ru>

[ Upstream commit a1299505162ad00def3573260c2c68b9c8e8d697 ]

When adding the code to handle platform_get_irq*() errors in the commit
489447380a29 ("handle errors returned by platform_get_irq*()"), the
actual error code was enforced to be -ENXIO in the driver for some
strange reason.  This didn't matter much until the deferred probing was
introduced -- which requires an actual error code to be propagated
upstream from the failure site.

While fixing this, also stop overriding the errors from request_irq() to
-EIO (done since the pre-git era).

Fixes: 489447380a29 ("[PATCH] handle errors returned by platform_get_irq*()")
