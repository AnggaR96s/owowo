From: "Matthieu Baerts (NGI0)" <matttbe@kernel.org>

commit d82809b6c5f2676b382f77a5cbeb1a5d91ed2235 upstream.

The initial subflow might have already been closed, but still in the
connection list. When the worker is instructed to close the subflows
that have been marked as closed, it might then try to close the initial
subflow again.

 A consequence of that is that the SUB_CLOSED event can be seen twice:

  # ip mptcp endpoint
  1.1.1.1 id 1 subflow dev eth0
  2.2.2.2 id 2 subflow dev eth1

  # ip mptcp monitor &
  [         CREATED] remid=0 locid=0 saddr4=1.1.1.1 daddr4=9.9.9.9
  [     ESTABLISHED] remid=0 locid=0 saddr4=1.1.1.1 daddr4=9.9.9.9
  [  SF_ESTABLISHED] remid=0 locid=2 saddr4=2.2.2.2 daddr4=9.9.9.9

  # ip mptcp endpoint delete id 1
  [       SF_CLOSED] remid=0 locid=0 saddr4=1.1.1.1 daddr4=9.9.9.9
  [       SF_CLOSED] remid=0 locid=0 saddr4=1.1.1.1 daddr4=9.9.9.9

The first one is coming from mptcp_pm_nl_rm_subflow_received(), and the
second one from __mptcp_close_subflow().

To avoid doing the post-closed processing twice, the subflow is now
marked as closed the first time.

Note that it is not enough to check if we are dealing with the first
subflow and check its sk_state: the subflow might have been reset or
closed before calling mptcp_close_ssk().

[ Conflict in protocol.h due to commit f1f26512a9bf ("mptcp: use plain
  bool instead of custom binary enum"), commit dfc8d0603033 ("mptcp:
  implement delayed seq generation for passive fastopen") and more that
  are not in this version, because they modify the context and the size
  of __unused. The conflict is easy to resolve, by not only adding the
  new field (close_event_done), and __unused. ]
