Subject: btrfs: delayed-inode: drop pointless BUG_ON in
 __btrfs_remove_delayed_item()

From: David Sterba <dsterba@suse.com>

[ Upstream commit 778e618b8bfedcc39354373c1b072c5fe044fa7b ]

There's a BUG_ON checking for a valid pointer of fs_info::delayed_root
but it is valid since init_mount_fs_info() and has the same lifetime as
fs_info.
