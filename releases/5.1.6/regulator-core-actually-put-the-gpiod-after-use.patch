Subject: regulator: core: Actually put the gpiod after use

[ Upstream commit 78927aa40bc82f32de07323ddc1c9de07ac68180 ]

I went to great lengths to hand over the management of the GPIO
descriptors to the regulator core, and some stray rebased
oneliner in the old patch must have been assuming the devices
were still doing devres management of it.

We handed the management over to the regulator core, so of
course the regulator core shall issue gpiod_put() when done.

Sorry for the descriptor leak.

Fixes: 541d052d7215 ("regulator: core: Only support passing enable GPIO descriptors")
