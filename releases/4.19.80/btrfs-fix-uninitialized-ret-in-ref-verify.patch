Subject: btrfs: fix uninitialized ret in ref-verify

From: Josef Bacik <josef@toxicpanda.com>

commit c5f4987e86f6692fdb12533ea1fc7a7bb98e555a upstream.

Coverity caught a case where we could return with a uninitialized value
in ret in process_leaf.  This is actually pretty likely because we could
very easily run into a block group item key and have a garbage value in
ret and think there was an errror.  Fix this by initializing ret to 0.
