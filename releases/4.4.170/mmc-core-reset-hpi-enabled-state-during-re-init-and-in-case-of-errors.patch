Subject: mmc: core: Reset HPI enabled state during re-init and in case of errors

From: Ulf Hansson <ulf.hansson@linaro.org>

commit a0741ba40a009f97c019ae7541dc61c1fdf41efb upstream.

During a re-initialization of the eMMC card, we may fail to re-enable HPI.
In these cases, that isn't properly reflected in the card->ext_csd.hpi_en
bit, as it keeps being set. This may cause following attempts to use HPI,
even if's not enabled. Let's fix this!
