Subject: btrfs: handle invalid root reference found in may_destroy_subvol()

From: David Sterba <dsterba@suse.com>

[ Upstream commit 6fbc6f4ac1f4907da4fc674251527e7dc79ffbf6 ]

The may_destroy_subvol() looks up a root by a key, allowing to do an
inexact search when key->offset is -1.  It's never expected to find such
item, as it would break the allowed range of a root id.
