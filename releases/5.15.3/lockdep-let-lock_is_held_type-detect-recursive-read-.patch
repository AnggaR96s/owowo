Subject: lockdep: Let lock_is_held_type() detect recursive read as read

From: Sebastian Andrzej Siewior <bigeasy@linutronix.de>

[ Upstream commit 2507003a1d10917c9158077bf6030719d02c941e ]

lock_is_held_type(, 1) detects acquired read locks. It only recognized
locks acquired with lock_acquire_shared(). Read locks acquired with
lock_acquire_shared_recursive() are not recognized because a `2' is
stored as the read value.

Rework the check to additionally recognise lock's read value one and two
as a read held lock.
