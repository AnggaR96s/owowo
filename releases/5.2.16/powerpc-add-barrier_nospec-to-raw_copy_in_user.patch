Subject: powerpc: Add barrier_nospec to raw_copy_in_user()

From: Suraj Jitindar Singh <sjitindarsingh@gmail.com>

commit 6fbcdd59094ade30db63f32316e9502425d7b256 upstream.

Commit ddf35cf3764b ("powerpc: Use barrier_nospec in copy_from_user()")
Added barrier_nospec before loading from user-controlled pointers. The
intention was to order the load from the potentially user-controlled
pointer vs a previous branch based on an access_ok() check or similar.

In order to achieve the same result, add a barrier_nospec to the
raw_copy_in_user() function before loading from such a user-controlled
pointer.
