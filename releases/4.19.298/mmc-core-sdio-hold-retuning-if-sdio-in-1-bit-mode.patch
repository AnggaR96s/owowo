Subject: mmc: core: sdio: hold retuning if sdio in 1-bit mode

From: Haibo Chen <haibo.chen@nxp.com>

[ Upstream commit 32a9cdb8869dc111a0c96cf8e1762be9684af15b ]

tuning only support in 4-bit mode or 8 bit mode, so in 1-bit mode,
need to hold retuning.

Find this issue when use manual tuning method on imx93. When system
resume back, SDIO WIFI try to switch back to 4 bit mode, first will
trigger retuning, and all tuning command failed.
