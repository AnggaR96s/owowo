Subject: arm64: dts: amd: Fix SPI bus warnings

From: Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit e9f0878c4b2004ac19581274c1ae4c61ae3ca70e ]

dtc has new checks for SPI buses. Fix the warnings in node names.

arch/arm64/boot/dts/amd/amd-overdrive.dtb: Warning (spi_bus_bridge): /smb/ssp@e1030000: node name for SPI buses should be 'spi'
arch/arm64/boot/dts/amd/amd-overdrive-rev-b0.dtb: Warning (spi_bus_bridge): /smb/ssp@e1030000: node name for SPI buses should be 'spi'
arch/arm64/boot/dts/amd/amd-overdrive-rev-b1.dtb: Warning (spi_bus_bridge): /smb/ssp@e1030000: node name for SPI buses should be 'spi'
