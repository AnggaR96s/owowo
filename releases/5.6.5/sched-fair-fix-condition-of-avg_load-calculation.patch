Subject: sched/fair: Fix condition of avg_load calculation

From: Tao Zhou <ouwen210@hotmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 6c8116c914b65be5e4d6f66d69c8142eb0648c22 ]

In update_sg_wakeup_stats(), the comment says:

Computing avg_load makes sense only when group is fully
busy or overloaded.

But, the code below this comment does not check like this.

From reading the code about avg_load in other functions, I
confirm that avg_load should be calculated in fully busy or
overloaded case. The comment is correct and the checking
condition is wrong. So, change that condition.
