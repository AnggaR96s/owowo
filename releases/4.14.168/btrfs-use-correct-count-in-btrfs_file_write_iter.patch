Subject: btrfs: use correct count in btrfs_file_write_iter()

From: Omar Sandoval <osandov@fb.com>

[ Upstream commit c09767a8960ca0500fb636bf73686723337debf4 ]

generic_write_checks() may modify iov_iter_count(), so we must get the
count after the call, not before. Using the wrong one has a couple of
consequences:

1. We check a longer range in check_can_nocow() for nowait than we're
   actually writing.
2. We create extra hole extent maps in btrfs_cont_expand(). As far as I
   can tell, this is harmless, but I might be missing something.

These issues are pretty minor, but let's fix it before something more
important trips on it.
