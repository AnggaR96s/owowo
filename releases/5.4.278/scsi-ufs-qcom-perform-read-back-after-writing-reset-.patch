Subject: scsi: ufs: qcom: Perform read back after writing reset bit

From: Andrew Halaney <ahalaney@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit c4d28e06b0c94636f6e35d003fa9ebac0a94e1ae ]

Currently, the reset bit for the UFS provided reset controller (used by its
phy) is written to, and then a mb() happens to try and ensure that hit the
device. Immediately afterwards a usleep_range() occurs.

mb() ensures that the write completes, but completion doesn't mean that it
isn't stored in a buffer somewhere. The recommendation for ensuring this
bit has taken effect on the device is to perform a read back to force it to
make it all the way to the device. This is documented in device-io.rst and
a talk by Will Deacon on this can be seen over here:

    https://youtu.be/i6DayghhA8Q?si=MiyxB5cKJXSaoc01&t=1678

Let's do that to ensure the bit hits the device. By doing so and
guaranteeing the ordering against the immediately following usleep_range(),
the mb() can safely be removed.
