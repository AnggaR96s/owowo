Subject: nvme-pci: do not set the NUMA node of device if it has none

From: Pratyush Yadav <ptyadav@amazon.de>

[ Upstream commit dad651b2a44eb6b201738f810254279dca29d30d ]

If a device has no NUMA node information associated with it, the driver
puts the device in node first_memory_node (say node 0). Not having a
NUMA node and being associated with node 0 are completely different
things and it makes little sense to mix the two.
