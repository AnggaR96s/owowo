Subject: riscv: Fixup race condition on PG_dcache_clean in flush_icache_pte

From: Guo Ren <guoren@linux.alibaba.com>

commit 950b879b7f0251317d26bae0687e72592d607532 upstream.

In commit 588a513d3425 ("arm64: Fix race condition on PG_dcache_clean
in __sync_icache_dcache()"), we found RISC-V has the same issue as the
previous arm64. The previous implementation didn't guarantee the correct
sequence of operations, which means flush_icache_all() hasn't been
called when the PG_dcache_clean was set. That would cause a risk of page
synchronization.

Fixes: 08f051eda33b ("RISC-V: Flush I$ when making a dirty page executable")
