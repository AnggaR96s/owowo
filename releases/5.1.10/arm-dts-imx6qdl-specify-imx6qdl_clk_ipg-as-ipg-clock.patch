Subject: ARM: dts: imx6qdl: Specify IMX6QDL_CLK_IPG as "ipg" clock to SDMA

[ Upstream commit b14c872eebc501b9640b04f4a152df51d6eaf2fc ]

Since 25aaa75df1e6 SDMA driver uses clock rates of "ipg" and "ahb"
clock to determine if it needs to configure the IP block as operating
at 1:1 or 1:2 clock ratio (ACR bit in SDMAARM_CONFIG). Specifying both
clocks as IMX6QDL_CLK_SDMA results in driver incorrectly thinking that
ratio is 1:1 which results in broken SDMA funtionality(this at least
breaks RAVE SP serdev driver on RDU2). Fix the code to specify
IMX6QDL_CLK_IPG as "ipg" clock for SDMA, to avoid detecting incorrect
clock ratio.
