Subject: ARM: dts: da850-evm: Correct the sound card name

[ Upstream commit 7fca69d4e43fa1ae9cb4f652772c132dc5a659c6 ]

To avoid  the following error:
asoc-simple-card sound: ASoC: Failed to create card debugfs directory

Which is because the card name contains '/' character, which can not be
used in file or directory names.
