Subject: ipv6: avoid atomic fragment on GSO packets

From: Yan Zhai <yan@cloudflare.com>

[ Upstream commit 03d6c848bfb406e9ef6d9846d759e97beaeea113 ]

When the ipv6 stack output a GSO packet, if its gso_size is larger than
dst MTU, then all segments would be fragmented. However, it is possible
for a GSO packet to have a trailing segment with smaller actual size
than both gso_size as well as the MTU, which leads to an "atomic
fragment". Atomic fragments are considered harmful in RFC-8021. An
Existing report from APNIC also shows that atomic fragments are more
likely to be dropped even it is equivalent to a no-op [1].

Add an extra check in the GSO slow output path. For each segment from
the original over-sized packet, if it fits with the path MTU, then avoid
generating an atomic fragment.
