Subject: io_uring/futex: always remove futex entry for cancel all

From: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>

[ Upstream commit 30dab608c3cb99c2a05b76289fd05551703979ae ]

We know the request is either being removed, or already in the process of
being removed through task_work, so we can delete it from our futex list
upfront. This is important for remove all conditions, as we otherwise
will find it multiple times and prevent cancelation progress.
