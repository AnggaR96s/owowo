Subject: nvme/pci: Fix write and poll queue types

From: Keith Busch <kbusch@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 3f68baf706ec68c4120867c25bc439c845fe3e17 ]

The number of poll or write queues should never be negative. Use unsigned
types so that it's not possible to break have the driver not allocate
any queues.
