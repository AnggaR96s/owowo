Subject: x86/resctrl: Don't stop walking closids when a locksetup group is found

From: James Morse <james.morse@arm.com>

commit 87d3aa28f345bea77c396855fa5d5fec4c24461f upstream.

When a new control group is created __init_one_rdt_domain() walks all
the other closids to calculate the sets of used and unused bits.

If it discovers a pseudo_locksetup group, it breaks out of the loop.  This
means any later closid doesn't get its used bits added to used_b.  These
bits will then get set in unused_b, and added to the new control group's
configuration, even if they were marked as exclusive for a later closid.

When encountering a pseudo_locksetup group, we should continue. This is
because "a resource group enters 'pseudo-locked' mode after the schemata is
written while the resource group is in 'pseudo-locksetup' mode." When we
find a pseudo_locksetup group, its configuration is expected to be
overwritten, we can skip it.
