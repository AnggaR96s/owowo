Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074: correct APCS register space size

From: Robert Marko <robimarko@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 40b21d466a86bd5b10d24f59746ed41283a9b3f6 ]

APCS DTS addition that was merged, was not supposed to get merged as it
was part of patch series that was superseded by 2 more patch series
that resolved issues with this one and greatly simplified things.

Since it already got merged, start by correcting the register space
size as APCS will not be providing regmap for PLL and it will conflict
with the standalone A53 PLL node.

Fixes: 50ed9fffec3a ("arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074: add APCS node")
