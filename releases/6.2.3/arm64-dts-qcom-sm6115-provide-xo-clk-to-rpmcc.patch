Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sm6115: Provide xo clk to rpmcc

From: Konrad Dybcio <konrad.dybcio@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit ad9514be8ddb9d3a8c262aa415c2f1c1f4cc97f9 ]

rpmcc used to rely on global clock lookup (and still does so for
backwards compat reasons) of "xo_board", which was common back
when we did not care about things like underscores in node names.
Nowadays it expects to be fed a reference to the fixed clock.
Satisfy that requirement to make sure rpm clock rates are not all
stuck at zero.
