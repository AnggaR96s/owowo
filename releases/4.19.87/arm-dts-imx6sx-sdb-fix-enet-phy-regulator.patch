Subject: ARM: dts: imx6sx-sdb: Fix enet phy regulator

From: Leonard Crestez <leonard.crestez@nxp.com>

[ Upstream commit 1ad9fb750a104f51851c092edd7b3553f0218428 ]

Bindings for "fixed-regulator" only explicitly support "gpio" property,
not "gpios". Fix by correcting the property name.

The enet PHYs on imx6sx-sdb needs to be explicitly reset after a power
cycle, this can be handled by the phy-reset-gpios property. Sadly this
is not handled on suspend: the fec driver turns phy-supply off but
doesn't assert phy-reset-gpios again on resume.

Since additional phy-level work is required to support powering off the
phy in suspend fix the problem by just marking the regulator as
"boot-on" "always-on" so that it's never turned off. This behavior is
equivalent to older releases.

Keep the phy-reset-gpios property on fec anyway because it is a correct
description of board design.

This issue was exposed by commit efdfeb079cc3 ("regulator: fixed:
Convert to use GPIO descriptor only") which causes the "gpios" property
to also be parsed. Before that commit the "gpios" property had no
effect, PHY reset was only handled in the the bootloader.

This fixes linux-next boot failures previously reported here:
