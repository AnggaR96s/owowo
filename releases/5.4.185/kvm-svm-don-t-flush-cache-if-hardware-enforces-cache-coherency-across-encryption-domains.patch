Subject: KVM: SVM: Don't flush cache if hardware enforces cache coherency across encryption domains

From: Krish Sadhukhan <krish.sadhukhan@oracle.com>

commit e1ebb2b49048c4767cfa0d8466f9c701e549fa5e upstream.

In some hardware implementations, coherency between the encrypted and
unencrypted mappings of the same physical page in a VM is enforced. In
such a system, it is not required for software to flush the VM's page
from all CPU caches in the system prior to changing the value of the
C-bit for the page.

So check that bit before flushing the cache.

[ The linux-5.4.y stable branch does not have the Linux 5.7 refactoring commit
  eaf78265a4ab ("KVM: SVM: Move SEV code to separate file") so the
  change was manually applied to sev_clflush_pages() in arch/x86/kvm/svm.c. ]
