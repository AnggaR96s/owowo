Subject: i2c: stm32f7: remove warning when compiling with W=1

From: Alain Volmat <alain.volmat@st.com>

[ Upstream commit 348e46fbb4cdb2aead79aee1fd8bb25ec5fd25db ]

Remove the following warning:

drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-stm32f7.c:315:
warning: cannot understand function prototype:
'struct stm32f7_i2c_spec i2c_specs[] =

Replace a comment starting with /** by simply /* to avoid having
it interpreted as a kernel-doc comment.
