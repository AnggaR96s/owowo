Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: fix RockPro64 sdmmc settings

From: Soeren Moch <smoch@web.de>

[ Upstream commit 5234c14531152702a9f3e575cb552b7e9cea9f94 ]

According to the RockPro64 schematic [1] the rk3399 sdmmc controller is
connected to a microSD (TF card) slot. Remove the cap-mmc-highspeed
property of the sdmmc controller, since no mmc card can be connected here.
