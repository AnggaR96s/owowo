Subject: ACPI: video: Add backlight=native quirk for Lenovo Slim 7 16ARH7

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

[ Upstream commit c901f63dc142c48326931f164f787dfff69273d9 ]

Lenovo Slim 7 16ARH7 is a machine with switchable graphics between AMD
and Nvidia, and the backlight can't be adjusted properly unless
acpi_backlight=native is passed.  Although nvidia-wmi-backlight is
present and loaded, this doesn't work as expected at all.

For making it working as default, add the corresponding quirk entry
with a DMI matching "LENOVO" "82UX".
