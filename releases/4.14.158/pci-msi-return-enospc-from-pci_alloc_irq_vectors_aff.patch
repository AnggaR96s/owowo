Subject: PCI/MSI: Return -ENOSPC from pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity()

From: Ming Lei <ming.lei@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 77f88abd4a6f73a1a68dbdc0e3f21575fd508fc3 ]

The API of pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity() says it returns -ENOSPC if
fewer than @min_vecs interrupt vectors are available for @dev.

However, if a device supports MSI-X but not MSI and a caller requests
@min_vecs that can't be satisfied by MSI-X, we previously returned -EINVAL
(from the failed attempt to enable MSI), not -ENOSPC.

When -ENOSPC is returned, callers may reduce the number IRQs they request
and try again.  Most callers can use the @min_vecs and @max_vecs
parameters to avoid this retry loop, but that doesn't work when using IRQ
affinity "nr_sets" because rebalancing the sets is driver-specific.

This return value bug has been present since pci_alloc_irq_vectors() was
added in v4.10 by aff171641d18 ("PCI: Provide sensible IRQ vector
alloc/free routines"), but it wasn't an issue because @min_vecs/@max_vecs
removed the need for callers to iteratively reduce the number of IRQs
requested and retry the allocation, so they didn't need to distinguish
-ENOSPC from -EINVAL.

In v5.0, 6da4b3ab9a6e ("genirq/affinity: Add support for allocating
interrupt sets") added IRQ sets to the interface, which reintroduced the
need to check for -ENOSPC and possibly reduce the number of IRQs requested
and retry the allocation.
