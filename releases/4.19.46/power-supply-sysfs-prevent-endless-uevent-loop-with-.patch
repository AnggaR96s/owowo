Subject: power: supply: sysfs: prevent endless uevent loop with
 CONFIG_POWER_SUPPLY_DEBUG

[ Upstream commit 349ced9984ff540ce74ca8a0b2e9b03dc434b9dd ]

Fix a similar endless event loop as was done in commit
8dcf32175b4e ("i2c: prevent endless uevent loop with
CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_CORE"):

  The culprit is the dev_dbg printk in the i2c uevent handler. If
  this is activated (for instance by CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_CORE) it results
  in an endless loop with systemd-journald.

  This happens if user-space scans the system log and reads the uevent
  file to get information about a newly created device, which seems
  fair use to me. Unfortunately reading the "uevent" file uses the
  same function that runs for creating the uevent for a new device,
  generating the next syslog entry

Both CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_CORE and CONFIG_POWER_SUPPLY_DEBUG were reported
in https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76886 but only former
seems to have been fixed. Drop debug prints as it was done in I2C
subsystem to resolve the issue.
