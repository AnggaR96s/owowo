Subject: ata: ahci_brcm: Add missing clock management during recovery

From: Florian Fainelli <f.fainelli@gmail.com>

commit bf0e5013bc2dcac205417e1252205dca39dfc005 upstream.

The downstream implementation of ahci_brcm.c did contain clock
management recovery, but until recently, did that outside of the
libahci_platform helpers and this was unintentionally stripped out while
forward porting the patch upstream.

Add the missing clock management during recovery and sleep for 10
milliseconds per the design team recommendations to ensure the SATA PHY
controller and AFE have been fully quiesced.
