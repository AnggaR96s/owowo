Subject: dt-bindings: backlight: lm3630a: correct schema validation

[ Upstream commit ef4db28c1f45cda6989bc8a8e45294894786d947 ]

The '#address-cells' and '#size-cells' properties were not defined in
the lm3630a bindings and would cause the following error when
attempting to validate the examples against the schema:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/backlight/lm3630a-backlight.example.dt.yaml:
'#address-cells', '#size-cells' do not match any of the regexes:
'^led@[01]$', 'pinctrl-[0-9]+'

Correct this by adding those two properties.

While we're here, move the ti,linear-mapping-mode property to the
led@[01] child nodes to correct the following validation error:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/backlight/lm3630a-backlight.example.dt.yaml:
led@0: 'ti,linear-mapping-mode' does not match any of the regexes:
'pinctrl-[0-9]+'
