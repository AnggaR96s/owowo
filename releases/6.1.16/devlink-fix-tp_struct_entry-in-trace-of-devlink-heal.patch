Subject: devlink: Fix TP_STRUCT_entry in trace of devlink health report

From: Moshe Shemesh <moshe@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit d0ab772c1f1558af84f3293a52e9e886e08e0754 ]

Fix a bug in trace point definition for devlink health report, as
TP_STRUCT_entry of reporter_name should get reporter_name and not msg.

Note no fixes tag as this is a harmless bug as both reporter_name and
msg are strings and TP_fast_assign for this entry is correct.
