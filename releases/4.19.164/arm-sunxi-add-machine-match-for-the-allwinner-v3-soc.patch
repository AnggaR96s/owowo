Subject: ARM: sunxi: Add machine match for the Allwinner V3 SoC

From: Paul Kocialkowski <contact@paulk.fr>

[ Upstream commit ad2091f893bd5dfe2824f0d6819600d120698e9f ]

The Allwinner V3 SoC shares the same base as the V3s but comes with
extra pins and features available. As a result, it has its dedicated
compatible string (already used in device trees), which is added here.
