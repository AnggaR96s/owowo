Subject: drm/rockchip: fix fb references in async update

From: Helen Koike <helen.koike@collabora.com>

commit d985a3533274ef7dd1ccb25cb05a72259b25268f upstream.

In the case of async update, modifications are done in place, i.e. in the
current plane state, so the new_state is prepared and the new_state is
cleaned up (instead of the old_state, unlike what happens in a
normal sync update).
To cleanup the old_fb properly, it needs to be placed in the new_state
in the end of async_update, so cleanup call will unreference the old_fb
correctly.

Also, the previous code had a:

	plane_state = plane->funcs->atomic_duplicate_state(plane);
	...
	swap(plane_state, plane->state);

	if (plane->state->fb && plane->state->fb != new_state->fb) {
	...
	}

Which was wrong, as the fb were just assigned to be equal, so this if
statement nevers evaluates to true.

Another details is that the function drm_crtc_vblank_get() can only be
called when vop->is_enabled is true, otherwise it has no effect and
trows a WARN_ON().

Calling drm_atomic_set_fb_for_plane() (which get a referent of the new
fb and pus the old fb) is not required, as it is taken care by
drm_mode_cursor_universal() when calling
drm_atomic_helper_update_plane().
