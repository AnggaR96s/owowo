Subject: x86/mce: Mark fatal MCE's page as poison to avoid panic in the kdump
 kernel

From: Zhiquan Li <zhiquan1.li@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 9f3b130048bfa2e44a8cfb1b616f826d9d5d8188 ]

Memory errors don't happen very often, especially fatal ones. However,
in large-scale scenarios such as data centers, that probability
increases with the amount of machines present.

When a fatal machine check happens, mce_panic() is called based on the
severity grading of that error. The page containing the error is not
marked as poison.

However, when kexec is enabled, tools like makedumpfile understand when
pages are marked as poison and do not touch them so as not to cause
a fatal machine check exception again while dumping the previous
kernel's memory.

Therefore, mark the page containing the error as poisoned so that the
kexec'ed kernel can avoid accessing the page.
