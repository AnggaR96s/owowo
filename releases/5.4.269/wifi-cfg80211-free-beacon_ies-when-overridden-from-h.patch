Subject: wifi: cfg80211: free beacon_ies when overridden from hidden BSS

From: Benjamin Berg <benjamin.berg@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 32af9a9e1069e55bc02741fb00ac9d0ca1a2eaef ]

This is a more of a cosmetic fix. The branch will only be taken if
proberesp_ies is set, which implies that beacon_ies is not set unless we
are connected to an AP that just did a channel switch. And, in that case
we should have found the BSS in the internal storage to begin with.
