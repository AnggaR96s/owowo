Subject: drm/amdkfd: fix some race conditions in vram buffer alloc/free of svm
 code

From: Xiaogang Chen <xiaogang.chen@amd.com>

[ Upstream commit 7bfaa160caed8192f8262c4638f552cad94bcf5a ]

This patch fixes:
1: ref number of prange's svm_bo got decreased by an async call from hmm. When
wait svm_bo of prange got released we shoul also wait prang->svm_bo become NULL,
otherwise prange->svm_bo may be set to null after allocate new vram buffer.

2: During waiting svm_bo of prange got released in a while loop should reschedule
current task to give other tasks oppotunity to run, specially the the workque
task that handles svm_bo ref release, otherwise we may enter to softlock.
