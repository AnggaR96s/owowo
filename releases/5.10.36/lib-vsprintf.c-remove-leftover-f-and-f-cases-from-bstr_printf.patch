Subject: lib/vsprintf.c: remove leftover 'f' and 'F' cases from bstr_printf()

From: Rasmus Villemoes <linux@rasmusvillemoes.dk>

commit 84696cfaf4d90945eb2a8302edc6cf627db56b84 upstream.

Commit 9af7706492f9 ("lib/vsprintf: Remove support for %pF and %pf in
favour of %pS and %ps") removed support for %pF and %pf, and correctly
removed the handling of those cases in vbin_printf(). However, the
corresponding cases in bstr_printf() were left behind.

In the same series, %pf was re-purposed for dealing with
fwnodes (3bd32d6a2ee6, "lib/vsprintf: Add %pfw conversion specifier
for printing fwnode names").

So should anyone use %pf with the binary printf routines,
vbin_printf() would (correctly, as it involves dereferencing the
pointer) do the string formatting to the u32 array, but bstr_printf()
would not copy the string from the u32 array, but instead interpret
the first sizeof(void*) bytes of the formatted string as a pointer -
which generally won't end well (also, all subsequent get_args would be
out of sync).
