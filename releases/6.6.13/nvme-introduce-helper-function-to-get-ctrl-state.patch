Subject: nvme: introduce helper function to get ctrl state

From: Keith Busch <kbusch@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 5c687c287c46fadb14644091823298875a5216aa ]

The controller state is typically written by another CPU, so reading it
should ensure no optimizations are taken. This is a repeated pattern in
the driver, so start with adding a convenience function that returns the
controller state with READ_ONCE().
