Subject: spi: Don't mark message DMA mapped when no transfer in it is

From: Andy Shevchenko <andriy.shevchenko@linux.intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 9f788ba457b45b0ce422943fcec9fa35c4587764 ]

There is no need to set the DMA mapped flag of the message if it has
no mapped transfers. Moreover, it may give the code a chance to take
the wrong paths, i.e. to exercise DMA related APIs on unmapped data.
Make __spi_map_msg() to bail earlier on the above mentioned cases.
