Subject: thermal: rcar_gen3_thermal: disable interrupt in .remove

[ Upstream commit 63f55fcea50c25ae5ad45af92d08dae3b84534c2 ]

Currently IRQ remains enabled after .remove, later if device is probed,
IRQ is requested before .thermal_init, this may cause IRQ function be
called before device is initialized.

this patch disables interrupt in .remove, to ensure irq function
only be called after device is fully initialized.
