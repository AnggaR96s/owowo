Subject: tty/vt: Do not warn when huge selection requested

From: Alexey Kardashevskiy <aik@ozlabs.ru>

commit 44c413d9a51752056d606bf6f312003ac1740fab upstream.

The tty TIOCL_SETSEL ioctl allocates a memory buffer big enough for text
selection area. The maximum allowed console size is
VC_RESIZE_MAXCOL * VC_RESIZE_MAXROW == 32767*32767 == ~1GB and typical
MAX_ORDER is set to allow allocations lot less than than (circa 16MB).

So it is quite possible to trigger huge allocation (and syzkaller just
did that) which is going to fail (which is fine) with a backtrace in
mm/page_alloc.c at WARN_ON_ONCE(!(gfp_mask & __GFP_NOWARN)) and
this may trigger panic (if panic_on_warn is enabled) and
leak kernel addresses to dmesg.

This passes __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc_array to avoid unnecessary user-
triggered WARN_ON. Note that the error is not ignored and
the warning is still printed.
