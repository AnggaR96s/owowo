Subject: arm64: dts: ti: k3-am65-main: Fix DSS irq trigger type

From: Tomi Valkeinen <tomi.valkeinen@ideasonboard.com>

[ Upstream commit b57160859263c083c49482b0d083a586b1517f78 ]

DSS irq trigger type is set to IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING in the DT file, but
the TRM says it is level triggered.

For some reason triggering on rising edge results in double the amount
of expected interrupts, e.g. for normal page flipping test the number of
interrupts per second is 2 * fps. It is as if the IRQ triggers on both
edges. There are no other side effects to this issue than slightly
increased CPU & power consumption due to the extra interrupt.

Switching to IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH is correct and fixes the issue, so
let's do that.
