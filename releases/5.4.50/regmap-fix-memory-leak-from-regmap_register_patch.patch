Subject: regmap: Fix memory leak from regmap_register_patch

From: Charles Keepax <ckeepax@opensource.cirrus.com>

[ Upstream commit 95b2c3ec4cb1689db2389c251d39f64490ba641c ]

When a register patch is registered the reg_sequence is copied but the
memory allocated is never freed. Add a kfree in regmap_exit to clean it
up.
