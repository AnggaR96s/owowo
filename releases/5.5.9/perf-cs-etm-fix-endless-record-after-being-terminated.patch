Subject: perf cs-etm: Fix endless record after being terminated

From: Wei Li <liwei391@huawei.com>

commit c9f2833cb472cf9e0a49b7bcdc210a96017a7bfd upstream.

In __cmd_record(), when receiving SIGINT(ctrl + c), a 'done' flag will
be set and the event list will be disabled by evlist__disable() once.

While in auxtrace_record.read_finish(), the related events will be
enabled again, if they are continuous, the recording seems to be
endless.

If the cs_etm event is disabled, we don't enable it again here.

Note: This patch is NOT tested since i don't have such a machine with
coresight feature, but the code seems buggy same as arm-spe and
intel-pt.

Tester notes:

Thanks for looping, Adrian.  Applied this patch and tested with
CoreSight on juno board, it works well.
