Subject: ice: Don't tell the OS that link is going down

From: Michal Swiatkowski <michal.swiatkowski@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 8a55c08d3bbc9ffc9639f69f742e59ebd99f913b ]

Remove code that tell the OS that link is going down when user
change flow control via ethtool. When link is up it isn't certain
that link goes down after 0x0605 aq command. If link doesn't go
down, OS thinks that link is down, but physical link is up. To
reset this state user have to take interface down and up.

If link goes down after 0x0605 command, FW send information
about that and after that driver tells the OS that the link goes
down. So this code in ethtool is unnecessary.
