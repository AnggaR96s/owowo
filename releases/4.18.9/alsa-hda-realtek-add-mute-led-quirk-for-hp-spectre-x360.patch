Subject: ALSA: hda/realtek - Add mute LED quirk for HP Spectre x360

From: Alexandru Gagniuc <mr.nuke.me@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 56e40eb6d656194e55ce2012fee9d5a496270aaa ]

This device has the same issues as the HP x360 wrt the MUTE LED and
the front speakers not working. This patch fixes the MUTE LED issue,
but doesn't touch the HDA verbs. The fix for the x360 does not work
on the Spectre.
