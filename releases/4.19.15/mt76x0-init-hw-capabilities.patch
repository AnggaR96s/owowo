Subject: mt76x0: init hw capabilities

From: Lorenzo Bianconi <lorenzo.bianconi@redhat.com>

commit 0ae976a11b4fb5704b597e103b5189237641c1a1 upstream.

Enable hw capabilities supported by mt76-usb layer
- fast_xmit
- tx/rx amsdu
- MFP
- non-linear tx skbs

[This is one line hw feature backport from 0ae976a11b4f ("mt76x0: init
hw capabilities"), which add also other different features, however
those are not supported in 4.19.

802.11w is supported by mac80211 and mt76x0u driver in 4.19 correctly
fall-back to software encryption when 802.11w ciphers are used.

Without the patch we fail to associate with WPA3 APs, so this is
considered as fix.]
