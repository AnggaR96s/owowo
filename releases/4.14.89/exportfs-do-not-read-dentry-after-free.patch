Subject: exportfs: do not read dentry after free

[ Upstream commit 2084ac6c505a58f7efdec13eba633c6aaa085ca5 ]

The function dentry_connected calls dput(dentry) to drop the previously
acquired reference to dentry. In this case, dentry can be released.
After that, IS_ROOT(dentry) checks the condition
(dentry == dentry->d_parent), which may result in a use-after-free bug.
This patch directly compares dentry with its parent obtained before
dropping the reference.

Fixes: a056cc8934c("exportfs: stop retrying once we race with
rename/remove")
