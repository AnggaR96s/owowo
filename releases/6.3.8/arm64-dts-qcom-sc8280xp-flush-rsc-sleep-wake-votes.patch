Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp: Flush RSC sleep & wake votes

From: Bjorn Andersson <quic_bjorande@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit ce7c014937c442be677963848c7db62eccd94eac ]

The rpmh driver will cache sleep and wake votes until the cluster
power-domain is about to enter idle, to avoid unnecessary writes. So
associate the apps_rsc with the cluster pd, so that it can be notified
about this event.

Without this, only AMC votes are being commited.
