Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: Add static properties to cryptobam

From: Luca Weiss <luca.weiss@fairphone.com>

[ Upstream commit 40ec6a2817d927367461fb0335b42b0d494ff927 ]

When the properties num-channels & qcom,num-ees are not specified, the
driver tries to read the values from registers, but this read fails and
resets the device if the interconnect from the qcom,qce node is not
already active when that happens.

Add the static properties to not touch any registers during probe, the
rest of the time when the BAM is used by QCE then the interconnect will
be active already.
