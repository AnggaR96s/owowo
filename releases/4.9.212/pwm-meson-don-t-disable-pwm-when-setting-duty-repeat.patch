Subject: pwm: meson: Don't disable PWM when setting duty repeatedly

From: Bichao Zheng <bichao.zheng@amlogic.com>

[ Upstream commit a279345807e1e0ae79567a52cfdd9d30c9174a3c ]

There is an abnormally low about 20ms,when setting duty repeatedly.
Because setting the duty will disable PWM and then enable. Delete
this operation now.

Fixes: 211ed630753d2f ("pwm: Add support for Meson PWM Controller")
