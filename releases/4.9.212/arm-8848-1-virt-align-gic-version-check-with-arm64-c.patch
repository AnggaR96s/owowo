Subject: ARM: 8848/1: virt: Align GIC version check with arm64 counterpart

From: Vladimir Murzin <vladimir.murzin@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit 9db043d36bd379f4cc99054c079de0dabfc38d03 ]

arm64 has got relaxation on GIC version check at early boot stage due
to update of the GIC architecture let's align ARM with that.

To help backports (even though the code was correct at the time of writing)
