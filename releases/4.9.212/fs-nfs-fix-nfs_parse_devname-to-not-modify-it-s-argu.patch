Subject: fs/nfs: Fix nfs_parse_devname to not modify it's argument

From: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>

[ Upstream commit 40cc394be1aa18848b8757e03bd8ed23281f572e ]

In the rare and unsupported case of a hostname list nfs_parse_devname
will modify dev_name.  There is no need to modify dev_name as the all
that is being computed is the length of the hostname, so the computed
length can just be shorted.

Fixes: dc04589827f7 ("NFS: Use common device name parsing logic for NFSv4 and NFSv2/v3")
