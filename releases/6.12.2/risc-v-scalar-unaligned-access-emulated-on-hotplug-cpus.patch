Subject: RISC-V: Scalar unaligned access emulated on hotplug CPUs

From: Jesse Taube <jesse@rivosinc.com>

commit 9c528b5f7927b857b40f3c46afbc869827af3c94 upstream.

The check_unaligned_access_emulated() function should have been called
during CPU hotplug to ensure that if all CPUs had emulated unaligned
accesses, the new CPU also does.

This patch adds the call to check_unaligned_access_emulated() in
the hotplug path.

Fixes: 55e0bf49a0d0 ("RISC-V: Probe misaligned access speed in parallel")
