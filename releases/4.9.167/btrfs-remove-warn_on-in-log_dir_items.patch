Subject: btrfs: remove WARN_ON in log_dir_items

From: Josef Bacik <josef@toxicpanda.com>

commit 2cc8334270e281815c3850c3adea363c51f21e0d upstream.

When Filipe added the recursive directory logging stuff in
2f2ff0ee5e430 ("Btrfs: fix metadata inconsistencies after directory
fsync") he specifically didn't take the directory i_mutex for the
children directories that we need to log because of lockdep.  This is
generally fine, but can lead to this WARN_ON() tripping if we happen to
run delayed deletion's in between our first search and our second search
of dir_item/dir_indexes for this directory.  We expect this to happen,
so the WARN_ON() isn't necessary.  Drop the WARN_ON() and add a comment
so we know why this case can happen.
