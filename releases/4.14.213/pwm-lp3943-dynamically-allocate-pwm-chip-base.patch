Subject: pwm: lp3943: Dynamically allocate PWM chip base
MIME-Version: 1.0

[ Upstream commit 1f0f1e80fdd3aa9631f6c22cda4f8550cfcfcc3e ]

When there are other PWM controllers enabled along with pwm-lp3943,
pwm-lp3942 is failing to probe with -EEXIST error. This is because
other PWM controllers are probed first and assigned PWM base 0 and
pwm-lp3943 is requesting for 0 again.

In order to avoid this, assign the chip base with -1, so that it is
dynamically allocated.
