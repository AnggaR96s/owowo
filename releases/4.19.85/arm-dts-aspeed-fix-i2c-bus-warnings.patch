Subject: ARM: dts: aspeed: Fix I2C bus warnings

From: Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 1426d40e11f730e0c0fd3700a7048082f87b0e6e ]

dtc has new checks for I2C buses. The ASpeed dts files have a node named
'i2c' which causes a false positive warning. As the node is a 'simple-bus',
correct the node name to be 'bus' to fix the warnings.
