Subject: ARM: dts: qcom: ipq4019: fix cpu0's qcom,saw2 reg value

From: Christian Lamparter <chunkeey@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit bd73a3dd257fb838bd456a18eeee0ef0224b7a40 ]

while compiling an ipq4019 target, dtc will complain:
regulator@b089000 unit address format error, expected "2089000"

The saw0 regulator reg value seems to be
copied and pasted from qcom-ipq8064.dtsi.

This patch fixes the reg value to match that of the
unit address which in turn silences the warning.
(There is no driver for qcom,saw2 right now.
So this went unnoticed)
