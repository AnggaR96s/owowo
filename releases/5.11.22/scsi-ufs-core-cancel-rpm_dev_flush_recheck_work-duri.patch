Subject: scsi: ufs: core: Cancel rpm_dev_flush_recheck_work during system
 suspend

From: Can Guo <cang@codeaurora.org>

[ Upstream commit 637822e63b79ee8a729f7ba2645a26cf5a524ee4 ]

During ufs system suspend, leaving rpm_dev_flush_recheck_work running or
pending is risky because concurrency may happen between system
suspend/resume and runtime resume routine. Fix this by cancelling
rpm_dev_flush_recheck_work synchronously during system suspend.
