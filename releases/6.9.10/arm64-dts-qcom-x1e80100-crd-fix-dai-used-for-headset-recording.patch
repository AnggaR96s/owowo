Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100-crd: fix DAI used for headset recording

From: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>

commit 74de2ecf1c418c96d2bffa7770953b8991425dd2 upstream.

The SWR2 Soundwire instance has 1 output and 4 input ports, so for the
headset recording (via the WCD9385 codec and the TX macro codec) we want
to use the next DAI, not the first one (see qcom,dout-ports and
qcom,din-ports for soundwire@6d30000 node).

Original code was copied from other devices like SM8450 and SM8550.  On
the SM8450 this was a correct setting, however on the SM8550 this worked
probably only by coincidence, because the DTS defined no output ports on
SWR2 Soundwire.

This is a necessary fix for proper audio recording via analogue
microphones connected to WCD9385 codec (e.g. headset AMIC2).
