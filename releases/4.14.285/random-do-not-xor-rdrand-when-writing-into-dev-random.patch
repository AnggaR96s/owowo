Subject: random: do not xor RDRAND when writing into /dev/random

From: "Jason A. Donenfeld" <Jason@zx2c4.com>

commit 91c2afca290ed3034841c8c8532e69ed9e16cf34 upstream.

Continuing the reasoning of "random: ensure early RDSEED goes through
mixer on init", we don't want RDRAND interacting with anything without
going through the mixer function, as a backdoored CPU could presumably
cancel out data during an xor, which it'd have a harder time doing when
being forced through a cryptographic hash function. There's actually no
need at all to be calling RDRAND in write_pool(), because before we
extract from the pool, we always do so with 32 bytes of RDSEED hashed in
at that stage. Xoring at this stage is needless and introduces a minor
liability.
