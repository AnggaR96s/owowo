Subject: random: re-add removed comment about get_random_{u32,u64} reseeding

From: "Jason A. Donenfeld" <Jason@zx2c4.com>

commit dd7aa36e535797926d8eb311da7151919130139d upstream.

The comment about get_random_{u32,u64}() not invoking reseeding got
added in an unrelated commit, that then was recently reverted by
0313bc278dac ("Revert "random: block in /dev/urandom""). So this adds
that little comment snippet back, and improves the wording a bit too.
