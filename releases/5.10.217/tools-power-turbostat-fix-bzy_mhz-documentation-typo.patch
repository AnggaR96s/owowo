Subject: tools/power turbostat: Fix Bzy_MHz documentation typo

From: Peng Liu <liupeng17@lenovo.com>

[ Upstream commit 0b13410b52c4636aacb6964a4253a797c0fa0d16 ]

The code calculates Bzy_MHz by multiplying TSC_delta * APERF_delta/MPERF_delta
The man page erroneously showed that TSC_delta was divided.

 Note that these calculations depend on TSC_delta, so they
 are not reliable during intervals when TSC_MHz is not running at the base frequency.
