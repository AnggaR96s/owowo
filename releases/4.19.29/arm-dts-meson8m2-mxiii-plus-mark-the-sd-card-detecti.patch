Subject: ARM: dts: meson8m2: mxiii-plus: mark the SD card detection GPIO
 active-low

[ Upstream commit 8615f5596335db0978cea593dcd0070dc5f8b116 ]

After commit 89a5e15bcba87d ("gpio/mmc/of: Respect polarity in the device
tree") SD cards are not detected anymore.

The CD GPIO is "active low" on the MXIII-Plus. The MMC dt-bindings
specify: "[...] using the "cd-inverted" property means, that the CD line
is active high, i.e. it is high, when a card is inserted".

Fix the description of the SD card by marking it as GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW and
drop the "cd-inverted" property. This makes the definition consistent
with the existing dt-bindings and fixes the check whether an SD card is
inserted.
