Subject: xfs: fix partially uninitialized structure in
 xfs_reflink_remap_extent

From: Darrick J. Wong <darrick.wong@oracle.com>

[ Upstream commit c142932c29e533ee892f87b44d8abc5719edceec ]

In the reflink extent remap function, it turns out that uirec (the block
mapping corresponding only to the part of the passed-in mapping that got
unmapped) was not fully initialized.  Specifically, br_state was not
being copied from the passed-in struct to the uirec.  This could lead to
unpredictable results such as the reflinked mapping being marked
unwritten in the destination file.
