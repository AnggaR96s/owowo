Subject: tracing: Set kernel_stack's caller size properly

From: Josef Bacik <jbacik@fb.com>

[ Upstream commit cbc3b92ce037f5e7536f6db157d185cd8b8f615c ]

I noticed when trying to use the trace-cmd python interface that reading the raw
buffer wasn't working for kernel_stack events.  This is because it uses a
stubbed version of __dynamic_array that doesn't do the __data_loc trick and
encode the length of the array into the field.  Instead it just shows up as a
size of 0.  So change this to __array and set the len to FTRACE_STACK_ENTRIES
since this is what we actually do in practice and matches how user_stack_trace
works.
