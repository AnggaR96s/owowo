Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix release of hwq to clear the eq relationship

From: James Smart <jsmart2021@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 821bc882accaaaf1bbecf5c0ecef659443e3e8cb ]

When performing reset testing, the eq's list for related hwqs was getting
corrupted.  In cases where there is not a 1:1 eq to hwq, the eq is
shared. The eq maintains a list of hwqs utilizing it in case of cpu
offlining and polling. During the reset, the hwqs are being torn down so
they can be recreated. The recreation was getting confused by seeing a
non-null eq assignment on the eq and the eq list became corrupt.

Correct by clearing the hdwq eq assignment when the hwq is cleaned up.
