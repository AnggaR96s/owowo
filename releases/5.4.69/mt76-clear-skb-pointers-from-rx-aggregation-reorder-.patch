Subject: mt76: clear skb pointers from rx aggregation reorder buffer during
 cleanup

From: Felix Fietkau <nbd@nbd.name>

[ Upstream commit 9379df2fd9234e3b67a23101c2370c99f6af6d77 ]

During the cleanup of the aggregation session, a rx handler (or release timer)
on another CPU might still hold a pointer to the reorder buffer and could
attempt to release some packets.
Clearing pointers during cleanup avoids a theoretical use-after-free bug here.
