Subject: ASoC: rt5640: Only cancel jack-detect work on suspend if active

From: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 8fc7cc507d61fc655172836c74fb7fcc8b7a978b ]

If jack-detection is not used; or has already been disabled then
there is no need to call rt5640_cancel_work().

Move the rt5640_cancel_work() inside the "if (rt5640->jack) {}" block,
grouping it together with the disabling of the IRQ which queues the work
in the first place.

This also makes suspend() symetrical with resume() which re-queues the work
in an "if (rt5640->jack) {}" block.
