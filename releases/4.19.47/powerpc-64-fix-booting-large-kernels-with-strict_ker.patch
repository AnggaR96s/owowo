Subject: powerpc/64: Fix booting large kernels with STRICT_KERNEL_RWX

[ Upstream commit 56c46bba9bbfe229b4472a5be313c44c5b714a39 ]

With STRICT_KERNEL_RWX enabled anything marked __init is placed at a 16M
boundary.  This is necessary so that it can be repurposed later with
different permissions.  However, in kernels with text larger than 16M,
this pushes early_setup past 32M, incapable of being reached by the
branch instruction.

Fix this by setting the CTR and branching there instead.
