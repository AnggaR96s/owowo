Subject: openrisc: Call setup_memory() earlier in the init sequence

From: Oreoluwa Babatunde <quic_obabatun@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit 7b432bf376c9c198a7ff48f1ed14a14c0ffbe1fe ]

The unflatten_and_copy_device_tree() function contains a call to
memblock_alloc(). This means that memblock is allocating memory before
any of the reserved memory regions are set aside in the setup_memory()
function which calls early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem(). Therefore,
there is a possibility for memblock to allocate from any of the
reserved memory regions.

Hence, move the call to setup_memory() to be earlier in the init
sequence so that the reserved memory regions are set aside before any
allocations are done using memblock.
