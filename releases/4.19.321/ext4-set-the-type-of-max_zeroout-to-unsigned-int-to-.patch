Subject: ext4: set the type of max_zeroout to unsigned int to avoid overflow

From: Baokun Li <libaokun1@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit 261341a932d9244cbcd372a3659428c8723e5a49 ]

The max_zeroout is of type int and the s_extent_max_zeroout_kb is of
type uint, and the s_extent_max_zeroout_kb can be freely modified via
the sysfs interface. When the block size is 1024, max_zeroout may
overflow, so declare it as unsigned int to avoid overflow.
