Subject: ALSA: fireworks: fix wrong return count shorter than expected by 4 bytes

From: Takashi Sakamoto <o-takashi@sakamocchi.jp>

commit eb9d84b0ffe39893cb23b0b6712bbe3637fa25fa upstream.

ALSA fireworks driver has a bug in its initial state to return count
shorter than expected by 4 bytes to userspace applications when handling
response frame for Echo Audio Fireworks transaction. It's due to missing
addition of the size for the type of event in ALSA firewire stack.
