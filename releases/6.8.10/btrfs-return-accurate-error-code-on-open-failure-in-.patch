Subject: btrfs: return accurate error code on open failure in
 open_fs_devices()

From: Anand Jain <anand.jain@oracle.com>

[ Upstream commit 2f1aeab9fca1a5f583be1add175d1ee95c213cfa ]

When attempting to exclusive open a device which has no exclusive open
permission, such as a physical device associated with the flakey dm
device, the open operation will fail, resulting in a mount failure.

In this particular scenario, we erroneously return -EINVAL instead of the
correct error code provided by the bdev_open_by_path() function, which is
-EBUSY.

Fix this, by returning error code from the bdev_open_by_path() function.
With this correction, the mount error message will align with that of
ext4 and xfs.
