Subject: cifs: add a warning when the in-flight count goes negative

From: Shyam Prasad N <sprasad@microsoft.com>

[ Upstream commit e4645cc2f1e2d6f268bb8dcfac40997c52432aed ]

We've seen the in-flight count go into negative with some
internal stress testing in Microsoft.

Adding a WARN when this happens, in hope of understanding
why this happens when it happens.
