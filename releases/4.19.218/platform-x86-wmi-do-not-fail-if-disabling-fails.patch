[ Upstream commit 1975718c488a39128f1f515b23ae61a5a214cc3d ]

Previously, `__query_block()` would fail if the
second WCxx method call failed. However, the
WQxx method might have succeeded, and potentially
allocated memory for the result. Instead of
throwing away the result and potentially
leaking memory, ignore the result of
the second WCxx call.
