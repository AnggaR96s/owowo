Subject: media: ir-kbd-i2c: improve responsiveness of hauppauge zilog receivers

From: Sean Young <sean@mess.org>

commit c73ba202a851c0b611ef2c25e568fadeff5e667f upstream.

The IR receiver has two issues:

 - Sometimes there is no response to a button press
 - Sometimes a button press is repeated when it should not have been

Hanging the polling interval fixes this behaviour.
