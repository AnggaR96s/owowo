Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix GPU register width for RK3328

From: Alex Bee <knaerzche@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 932b4610f55b49f3a158b0db451137bab7ed0e1f ]

As can be seen in RK3328's TRM the register range for the GPU is
0xff300000 to 0xff330000.
It would (and does in vendor kernel) overlap with the registers of
the HEVC encoder (node/driver do not exist yet in upstream kernel).
See already existing h265e_mmu node.
