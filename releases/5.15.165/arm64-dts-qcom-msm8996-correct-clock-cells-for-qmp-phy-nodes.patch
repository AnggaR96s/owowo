Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: correct #clock-cells for QMP PHY nodes

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

commit b874fff9a7683df30e5aff16d5a85b1f8a43aa5d upstream.

The commit 82d61e19fccb ("arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Move '#clock-cells'
to QMP PHY child node") moved the '#clock-cells' properties to the child
nodes. However it missed the fact that the property must have been set
to <0> (as all pipe clocks use of_clk_hw_simple_get as the xlate
function. Also the mentioned commit didn't add '#clock-cells' properties
to second and third PCIe PHY nodes. Correct both these mistakes:

- Set '#clock-cells' to <0>,
- Add the property to pciephy_1 and pciephy_2 nodes.

Fixes: 82d61e19fccb ("arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Move '#clock-cells' to QMP PHY child node")
