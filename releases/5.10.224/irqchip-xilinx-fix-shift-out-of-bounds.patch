Subject: irqchip/xilinx: Fix shift out of bounds

From: Radhey Shyam Pandey <radhey.shyam.pandey@amd.com>

commit d73f0f49daa84176c3beee1606e73c7ffb6af8b2 upstream.

The device tree property 'xlnx,kind-of-intr' is sanity checked that the
bitmask contains only set bits which are in the range of the number of
interrupts supported by the controller.

The check is done by shifting the mask right by the number of supported
interrupts and checking the result for zero.

The data type of the mask is u32 and the number of supported interrupts is
up to 32. In case of 32 interrupts the shift is out of bounds, resulting in
a mismatch warning. The out of bounds condition is also reported by UBSAN:

  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in irq-xilinx-intc.c:332:22
  shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'unsigned int'

Fix it by promoting the mask to u64 for the test.
