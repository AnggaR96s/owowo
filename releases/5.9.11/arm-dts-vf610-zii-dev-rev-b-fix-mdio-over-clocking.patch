Subject: ARM: dts: vf610-zii-dev-rev-b: Fix MDIO over clocking

From: Andrew Lunn <andrew@lunn.ch>

[ Upstream commit f8b5a33707c9a19ec905d2826be0acd151997a09 ]

The ZII devel B board has two generations of Marvell Switches.  The
mv88e6352 supports an MDIO clock of 12MHz. However the older 88e6185
does not like 12MHz, and often fails to probe.

Reduce the clock speed to 5MHz, which seems to work reliably.
