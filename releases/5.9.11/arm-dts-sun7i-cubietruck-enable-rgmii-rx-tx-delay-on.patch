Subject: ARM: dts: sun7i: cubietruck: Enable RGMII RX/TX delay on Ethernet PHY
MIME-Version: 1.0

[ Upstream commit 353c3de1303fc93032164402c0eb8550ecd6f154 ]

The Ethernet PHY on the Cubietruck has the RX and TX delays
enabled on the PHY, using pull-ups on the RXDLY and TXDLY pins.

Fix the phy-mode description to correct reflect this so that the
implementation doesn't reconfigure the delays incorrectly. This
happened with commit bbc4d71d6354 ("net: phy: realtek: fix rtl8211e
rx/tx delay config").
