Subject: net: ena: ena-com.c: prevent NULL pointer dereference

From: Arthur Kiyanovski <akiyano@amazon.com>

[ Upstream commit c207979f5ae10ed70aff1bb13f39f0736973de99 ]

comp_ctx can be NULL in a very rare case when an admin command is executed
during the execution of ena_remove().

The bug scenario is as follows:

* ena_destroy_device() sets the comp_ctx to be NULL
* An admin command is executed before executing unregister_netdev(),
  this can still happen because our device can still receive callbacks
  from the netdev infrastructure such as ethtool commands.
* When attempting to access the comp_ctx, the bug occurs since it's set
  to NULL

Fix:
Added a check that comp_ctx is not NULL

Fixes: 1738cd3ed342 ("net: ena: Add a driver for Amazon Elastic Network Adapters (ENA)")
