Subject: entry/kvm: Exit to user mode when TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL is set

From: Seth Forshee <sforshee@digitalocean.com>

[ Upstream commit 3e684903a8574ffc9475fdf13c4780a7adb506ad ]

A livepatch transition may stall indefinitely when a kvm vCPU is heavily
loaded. To the host, the vCPU task is a user thread which is spending a
very long time in the ioctl(KVM_RUN) syscall. During livepatch
transition, set_notify_signal() will be called on such tasks to
interrupt the syscall so that the task can be transitioned. This
interrupts guest execution, but when xfer_to_guest_mode_work() sees that
TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL is set but not TIF_SIGPENDING it concludes that an
exit to user mode is unnecessary, and guest execution is resumed without
transitioning the task for the livepatch.

This handling of TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL is incorrect, as set_notify_signal()
is expected to break tasks out of interruptible kernel loops and cause
them to return to userspace. Change xfer_to_guest_mode_work() to handle
TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL the same as TIF_SIGPENDING, signaling to the vCPU run
loop that an exit to userpsace is needed. Any pending task_work will be
run when get_signal() is called from exit_to_user_mode_loop(), so there
is no longer any need to run task work from xfer_to_guest_mode_work().
