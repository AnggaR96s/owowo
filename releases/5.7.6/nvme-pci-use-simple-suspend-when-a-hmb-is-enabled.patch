Subject: nvme-pci: use simple suspend when a HMB is enabled

From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>

[ Upstream commit b97120b15ebd3de51325084136d3b9c3cce656d6 ]

While the NVMe specification allows the device to access the host memory
buffer in host DRAM from all power states, hosts will fail access to
DRAM during S3 and similar power states.

Fixes: d916b1be94b6 ("nvme-pci: use host managed power state for suspend")
