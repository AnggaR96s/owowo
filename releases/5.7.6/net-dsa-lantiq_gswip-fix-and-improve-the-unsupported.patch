Subject: net: dsa: lantiq_gswip: fix and improve the unsupported interface
 error

From: Martin Blumenstingl <martin.blumenstingl@googlemail.com>

[ Upstream commit 4d3da2d8d91f66988a829a18a0ce59945e8ae4fb ]

While trying to use the lantiq_gswip driver on one of my boards I made
a mistake when specifying the phy-mode (because the out-of-tree driver
wants phy-mode "gmii" or "mii" for the internal PHYs). In this case the
following error is printed multiple times:
  Unsupported interface: 3

While it gives at least a hint at what may be wrong it is not very user
friendly. Print the human readable phy-mode and also which port is
configured incorrectly (this hardware supports ports 0..6) to improve
the cases where someone made a mistake.
