Subject: hwmon: (ina2xx) Fix current value calculation

[ Upstream commit 38cd989ee38c16388cde89db5b734f9d55b905f9 ]

The current register (04h) has a sign bit at MSB. The comments
for this calculation also mention that it's a signed register.

However, the regval is unsigned type so result of calculation
turns out to be an incorrect value when current is negative.

This patch simply fixes this by adding a casting to s16.
