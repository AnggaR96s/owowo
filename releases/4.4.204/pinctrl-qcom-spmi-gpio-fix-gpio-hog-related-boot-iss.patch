Subject: pinctrl: qcom: spmi-gpio: fix gpio-hog related boot issues

From: Brian Masney <masneyb@onstation.org>

[ Upstream commit 149a96047237574b756d872007c006acd0cc6687 ]

When attempting to setup up a gpio hog, device probing would repeatedly
fail with -EPROBE_DEFERED errors. It was caused by a circular dependency
between the gpio and pinctrl frameworks. If the gpio-ranges property is
present in device tree, then the gpio framework will handle the gpio pin
registration and eliminate the circular dependency.

See Christian Lamparter's commit a86caa9ba5d7 ("pinctrl: msm: fix
gpio-hog related boot issues") for a detailed commit message that
explains the issue in much more detail. The code comment in this commit
came from Christian's commit.
