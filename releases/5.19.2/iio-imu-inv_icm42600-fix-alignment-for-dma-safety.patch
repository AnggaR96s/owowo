Subject: iio: imu: inv_icm42600: Fix alignment for DMA safety

[ Upstream commit 848847702bd10bf0bf547e38adc44c14e9742784 ]

Partial fix for this driver as a second instance was introduced in
a later patch.

____cacheline_aligned is an insufficient guarantee for non-coherent DMA
on platforms with 128 byte cachelines above L1.  Switch to the updated
IIO_DMA_MINALIGN definition.
