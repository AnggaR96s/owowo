Subject: clk: qcom: gdsc: Bump parent usage count when GDSC is found enabled

From: Bjorn Andersson <bjorn.andersson@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 41fff779d7948147f2440c4bb134cdf8b45b22d7 ]

When a GDSC is found to be enabled at boot the pm_runtime state will
be unbalanced as the GDSC is later turned off. Fix this by increasing
the usage counter on the power-domain, in line with how we handled the
regulator state.
