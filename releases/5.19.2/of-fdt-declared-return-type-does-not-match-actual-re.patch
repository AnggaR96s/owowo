[ Upstream commit 7913145afa51bbed9eaf8e5b4ee55fa9884a71e5 ]

The commit 649cab56de8e (“of: properly check for error returned
by fdt_get_name()”) changed the return value type from bool to int,
but forgot to change the return value simultaneously.

populate_node was only called in unflatten_dt_nodes, and returns
with values greater than or equal to 0 were discarded without further
processing. Considering that return 0 usually indicates success,
return 0 instead of return true.

Fixes: 649cab56de8e (“of: properly check for error returned by fdt_get_name()”)
