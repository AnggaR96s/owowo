Subject: dm thin: restore requested 'error_if_no_space' setting on OODS to
 WRITE transition

[ Upstream commit 172c238612ebf81cabccc86b788c9209af591f61 ]

A thin-pool that is in out-of-data-space (OODS) mode may transition back
to write mode -- without the admin adding more space to the thin-pool --
if/when blocks are released (either by deleting thin devices or
discarding provisioned blocks).

But as part of the thin-pool's earlier transition to out-of-data-space
mode the thin-pool may have set the 'error_if_no_space' flag to true if
the no_space_timeout expires without more space having been made
available.  That implementation detail, of changing the pool's
error_if_no_space setting, needs to be reset back to the default that
the user specified when the thin-pool's table was loaded.

Otherwise we'll drop the user requested behaviour on the floor when this
out-of-data-space to write mode transition occurs.
