Subject: KEYS: put keyring if install_session_keyring_to_cred() fails

[ Upstream commit d636bd9f12a66ea3775c9fabbf3f8e118253467a ]

In join_session_keyring(), if install_session_keyring_to_cred() were to
fail, we would leak the keyring reference, just like in the bug fixed by
commit 23567fd052a9 ("KEYS: Fix keyring ref leak in
join_session_keyring()").  Fortunately this cannot happen currently, but
we really should be more careful.  Do this by adding and using a new
error label at which the keyring reference is dropped.
