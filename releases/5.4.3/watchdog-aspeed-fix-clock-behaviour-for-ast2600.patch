Subject: watchdog: aspeed: Fix clock behaviour for ast2600
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

From: Joel Stanley <joel@jms.id.au>

[ Upstream commit c04571251b3d842096f1597f5d4badb508be016d ]

The ast2600 no longer uses bit 4 in the control register to indicate a
1MHz clock (It now controls whether this watchdog is reset by a SOC
reset). This means we do not want to set it. It also does not need to be
set for the ast2500, as it is read-only on that SoC.

The comment next to the clock rate selection wandered away from where it
was set, so put it back next to the register setting it's describing.
