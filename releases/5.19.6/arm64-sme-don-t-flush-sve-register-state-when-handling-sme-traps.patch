Subject: arm64/sme: Don't flush SVE register state when handling SME traps

From: Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>

commit 714f3cbd70a4db9f9b7fe5b8a032896ed33fb824 upstream.

Currently as part of handling a SME access trap we flush the SVE register
state. This is not needed and would corrupt register state if the task has
access to the SVE registers already. For non-streaming mode accesses the
required flushing will be done in the SVE access trap. For streaming
mode SVE register accesses the architecture guarantees that the register
state will be flushed when streaming mode is entered or exited so there is
no need for us to do so. Simply remove the register initialisation.
