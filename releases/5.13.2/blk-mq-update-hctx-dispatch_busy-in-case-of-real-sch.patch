Subject: blk-mq: update hctx->dispatch_busy in case of real scheduler

From: Ming Lei <ming.lei@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit cb9516be7708a2a18ec0a19fe3a225b5b3bc92c7 ]

Commit 6e6fcbc27e77 ("blk-mq: support batching dispatch in case of io")
starts to support io batching submission by using hctx->dispatch_busy.

However, blk_mq_update_dispatch_busy() isn't changed to update hctx->dispatch_busy
in that commit, so fix the issue by updating hctx->dispatch_busy in case
of real scheduler.
