Subject: treewide: fix up files incorrectly marked executable

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

[ Upstream commit 262b42e02d1e0b5ad1b33e9b9842e178c16231de ]

I'm not exactly clear on what strange workflow causes people to do it,
but clearly occasionally some files end up being committed as executable
even though they clearly aren't.

This is a reprise of commit 90fda63fa115 ("treewide: fix up files
incorrectly marked executable"), just with a different set of files (but
with the same trivial shell scripting).

So apparently we need to re-do this every five years or so, and Joe
needs to just keep reminding me to do so ;)
