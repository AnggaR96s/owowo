Subject: scsi: storvsc: Fix calculation of sub-channel count

[ Upstream commit 382e06d11e075a40b4094b6ef809f8d4bcc7ab2a ]

When the number of sub-channels offered by Hyper-V is >= the number of CPUs
in the VM, calculate the correct number of sub-channels.  The current code
produces one too many.

This scenario arises only when the number of CPUs is artificially
restricted (for example, with maxcpus=<n> on the kernel boot line), because
Hyper-V normally offers a sub-channel count < number of CPUs.  While the
current code doesn't break, the extra sub-channel is unbalanced across the
CPUs (for example, a total of 5 channels on a VM with 4 CPUs).
