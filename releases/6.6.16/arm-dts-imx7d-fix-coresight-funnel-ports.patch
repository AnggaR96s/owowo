Subject: ARM: dts: imx7d: Fix coresight funnel ports

From: Alexander Stein <alexander.stein@ew.tq-group.com>

[ Upstream commit 0d4ac04fa7c3f6dc263dba6f575a2ec7a2d4eca8 ]

imx7d uses two ports for 'in-ports', so the syntax port@<num> has to
be used. imx7d has both port and port@1 nodes present, raising these
error:
funnel@30041000: in-ports: More than one condition true in oneOf schema
funnel@30041000: Unevaluated properties are not allowed
('in-ports' was unexpected)

Fix this by also using port@0 for imx7s as well.
