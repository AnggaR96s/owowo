Subject: locking: Remove smp_read_barrier_depends() from
 queued_spin_lock_slowpath()

commit 548095dea63ffc016d39c35b32c628d033638aca upstream.

Queued spinlocks are not used by DEC Alpha, and furthermore operations
such as READ_ONCE() and release/relaxed RMW atomics are being changed
to imply smp_read_barrier_depends().  This commit therefore removes the
now-redundant smp_read_barrier_depends() from queued_spin_lock_slowpath(),
and adjusts the comments accordingly.
