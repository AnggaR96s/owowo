Subject: arm64: dts: imx8mm: Reduce GPU to nominal speed

From: Adam Ford <aford173@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 1f794d3eed5345413c2b0cf1bcccc92d77681220 ]

When the GPU nodes were added, the GPU_PLL_OUT was configured
for 1000MHz, but this requires the SoC to run in overdrive mode
which requires an elevated voltage operating point.

Since this may run some boards out of spec, the default clock
should be set to 800MHz for nominal operating mode. Boards
that run at the higher voltage can update their clocks
accordingly.
