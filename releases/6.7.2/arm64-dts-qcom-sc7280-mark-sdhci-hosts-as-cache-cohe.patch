Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: Mark SDHCI hosts as cache-coherent

From: Konrad Dybcio <konrad.dybcio@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 827f5fc8d912203c1f971e47d61130b13c6820ba ]

The SDHCI hosts on SC7280 are cache-coherent, just like on most fairly
recent Qualcomm SoCs. Mark them as such.

Fixes: 298c81a7d44f ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: Add nodes for eMMC and SD card")
