commit 3bfc37d92687b4b19056998cebc02f94fbc81427 upstream.

b3574f579ece ("PCI: mvebu: Mark driver as BROKEN") made it impossible to
enable the pci-mvebu driver.  The driver does have known problems, but as
Russell and Uwe reported, it does work in some configurations, so removing
it broke some working setups.

Revert b3574f579ece so pci-mvebu is available.
