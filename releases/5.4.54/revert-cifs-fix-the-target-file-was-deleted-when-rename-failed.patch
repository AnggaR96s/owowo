Subject: Revert "cifs: Fix the target file was deleted when rename failed."

From: Steve French <stfrench@microsoft.com>

commit 0e6705182d4e1b77248a93470d6d7b3013d59b30 upstream.

This reverts commit 9ffad9263b467efd8f8dc7ae1941a0a655a2bab2.

Upon additional testing with older servers, it was found that
the original commit introduced a regression when using the old SMB1
dialect and rsyncing over an existing file.

The patch will need to be respun to address this, likely including
a larger refactoring of the SMB1 and SMB3 rename code paths to make
it less confusing and also to address some additional rename error
cases that SMB3 may be able to workaround.
