Subject: selftests/seccomp: Set NNP for TSYNC ESRCH flag test

From: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>

commit e4d05028a07f505a08802a6d1b11674c149df2b3 upstream.

The TSYNC ESRCH flag test will fail for regular users because NNP was
not set yet. Add NNP setting.

Fixes: 51891498f2da ("seccomp: allow TSYNC and USER_NOTIF together")
