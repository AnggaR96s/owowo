Subject: ARM: dts: at91: sam9x60ek: fix eeprom compatible and size

From: Eugen Hristev <eugen.hristev@microchip.com>

[ Upstream commit f2cbbc3f926316ccf8ef9363d8a60c1110afc1c7 ]

The board has a microchip 24aa025e48 eeprom, which is a 2 Kbits memory,
so it's compatible with at24c02 not at24c32.
Also the size property is wrong, it's not 128 bytes, but 256 bytes.
Thus removing and leaving it to the default (256).

Fixes: 1e5f532c27371 ("ARM: dts: at91: sam9x60: add device tree for soc and board")
