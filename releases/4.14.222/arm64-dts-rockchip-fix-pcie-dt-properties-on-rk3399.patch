Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix PCIe DT properties on rk3399

From: Marc Zyngier <maz@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 43f20b1c6140896916f4e91aacc166830a7ba849 ]

It recently became apparent that the lack of a 'device_type = "pci"'
in the PCIe root complex node for rk3399 is a violation of the PCI
binding, as documented in IEEE Std 1275-1994. Changes to the kernel's
parsing of the DT made such violation fatal, as drivers cannot
probe the controller anymore.

Add the missing property makes the PCIe node compliant. While we
are at it, drop the pointless linux,pci-domain property, which only
makes sense when there are multiple host bridges.
