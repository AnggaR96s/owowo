Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: pmk8350: fix ADC-TM compatible string

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 435a73d7377ceb29c1a22d2711dd85c831b40c45 ]

The commit b2de43136058 ("arm64: dts: qcom: pmk8350: Add peripherals for
pmk8350") for the ADC TM (thermal monitoring device) have used the
compatible string from the vendor kernel ("qcom,adc-tm7"). Use the
proper compatible string that is defined in the upstream kernel
("qcom,spmi-adc-tm5-gen2").
