Subject: qed: fix ethtool register dump

From: Manish Chopra <manishc@marvell.com>

commit 20921c0c86092b4082c91bd7c88305da74e5520b upstream.

To fix a coverity complain, commit d5ac07dfbd2b
("qed: Initialize debug string array") removed "sw-platform"
(one of the common global parameters) from the dump as this
was used in the dump with an uninitialized string, however
it did not reduce the number of common global parameters
which caused the incorrect (unable to parse) register dump

this patch fixes it with reducing NUM_COMMON_GLOBAL_PARAMS
bye one.
