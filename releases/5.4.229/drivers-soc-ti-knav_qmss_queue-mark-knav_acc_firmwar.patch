Subject: drivers: soc: ti: knav_qmss_queue: Mark knav_acc_firmwares as static

From: Chen Jiahao <chenjiahao16@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit adf85adc2a7199b41e7a4da083bd17274a3d6969 ]

There is a sparse warning shown below:

drivers/soc/ti/knav_qmss_queue.c:70:12: warning: symbol
'knav_acc_firmwares' was not declared. Should it be static?

Since 'knav_acc_firmwares' is only called within knav_qmss_queue.c,
mark it as static to fix the warning.

Fixes: 96ee19becc3b ("soc: ti: add firmware file name as part of the driver")
