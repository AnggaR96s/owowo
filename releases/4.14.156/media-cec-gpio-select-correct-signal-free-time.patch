Subject: media: cec-gpio: select correct Signal Free Time

From: Hans Verkuil <hans.verkuil@cisco.com>

[ Upstream commit c439d5c1e13dbf66cff53455432f21d4d0536c51 ]

If a receive is in progress or starts before the transmit has
a chance, then lower the Signal Free Time of the upcoming transmit
to no more than CEC_SIGNAL_FREE_TIME_NEW_INITIATOR.

This is per the specification requirements.
