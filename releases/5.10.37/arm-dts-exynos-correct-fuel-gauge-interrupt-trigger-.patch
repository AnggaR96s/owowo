Subject: ARM: dts: exynos: correct fuel gauge interrupt trigger level on
 GT-I9100

From: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzk@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 46799802136670e00498f19898f1635fbc85f583 ]

The Maxim fuel gauge datasheets describe the interrupt line as active
low with a requirement of acknowledge from the CPU.  The falling edge
interrupt will mostly work but it's not correct.
