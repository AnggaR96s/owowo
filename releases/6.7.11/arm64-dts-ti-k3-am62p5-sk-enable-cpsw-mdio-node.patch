Subject: arm64: dts: ti: k3-am62p5-sk: Enable CPSW MDIO node

From: Ravi Gunasekaran <r-gunasekaran@ti.com>

[ Upstream commit 8839a9af397e803e0447a6b3e69fad54ed22d26d ]

Enable the CPSW MDIO node, and link the pinctrl information to enable
ethernet on SK-AM62P.

Ethernet was unintentally broken on this board, even though these nodes
were already present, as enabling them was missed in the original
patch.

Fixes: c00504ea42c0 ("arm64: dts: ti: k3-am62p5-sk: Updates for SK EVM")
