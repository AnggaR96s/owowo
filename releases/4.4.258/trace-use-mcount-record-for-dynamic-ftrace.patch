Subject: trace: Use -mcount-record for dynamic ftrace

From: Andi Kleen <ak@linux.intel.com>

commit 96f60dfa5819a065bfdd2f2ba0df7d9cbce7f4dd upstream.

gcc 5 supports a new -mcount-record option to generate ftrace
tables directly. This avoids the need to run record_mcount
manually.

Use this option when available.

So far doesn't use -mcount-nop, which also exists now.

This is needed to make ftrace work with LTO because the
normal record-mcount script doesn't run over the link
time output.

It should also improve build times slightly in the general
case.
