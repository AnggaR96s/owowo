Subject: KVM: PPC: Book3S HV Nested: L2 LPCR should inherit L1 LPES setting

From: Nicholas Piggin <npiggin@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 2852ebfa10afdcefff35ec72c8da97141df9845c ]

The L1 should not be able to adjust LPES mode for the L2. Setting LPES
if the L0 needs it clear would cause external interrupts to be sent to
L2 and missed by the L0.

Clearing LPES when it may be set, as typically happens with XIVE enabled
could cause a performance issue despite having no native XIVE support in
the guest, because it will cause mediated interrupts for the L2 to be
taken in HV mode, which then have to be injected.
