Subject: scsi: lpfc: Return DID_TRANSPORT_DISRUPTED instead of DID_REQUEUE

From: Hannes Reinecke <hare@suse.de>

[ Upstream commit c0a50cd389c3ed54831e240023dd12bafa56b3a6 ]

When the driver hits an internal error condition returning DID_REQUEUE the
I/O will be retried on the same ITL nexus.  This will inhibit multipathing,
resulting in endless retries even if the error could have been resolved by
using a different ITL nexus.  Return DID_TRANSPORT_DISRUPTED to allow for
multipath to engage and route I/O to another ITL nexus.
