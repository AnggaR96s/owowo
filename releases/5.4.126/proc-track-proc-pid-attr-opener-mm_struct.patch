Subject: proc: Track /proc/$pid/attr/ opener mm_struct

From: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>

commit 591a22c14d3f45cc38bd1931c593c221df2f1881 upstream.

Commit bfb819ea20ce ("proc: Check /proc/$pid/attr/ writes against file opener")
tried to make sure that there could not be a confusion between the opener of
a /proc/$pid/attr/ file and the writer. It used struct cred to make sure
the privileges didn't change. However, there were existing cases where a more
privileged thread was passing the opened fd to a differently privileged thread
(during container setup). Instead, use mm_struct to track whether the opener
and writer are still the same process. (This is what several other proc files
already do, though for different reasons.)
