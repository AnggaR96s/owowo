Subject: Abort file_remove_privs() for non-reg. files

From: Alexander Lochmann <alexander.lochmann@tu-dortmund.de>

commit f69e749a49353d96af1a293f56b5b56de59c668a upstream.

file_remove_privs() might be called for non-regular files, e.g.
blkdev inode. There is no reason to do its job on things
like blkdev inodes, pipes, or cdevs. Hence, abort if
file does not refer to a regular inode.

AV: more to the point, for devices there might be any number of
inodes refering to given device.  Which one to strip the permissions
from, even if that made any sense in the first place?  All of them
will be observed with contents modified, after all.
