Subject: Revert "serial: core: only stop transmit when HW fifo is empty"

From: Doug Brown <doug@schmorgal.com>

commit c5603e2a621dac10c5e21cc430848ebcfa6c7e01 upstream.

This reverts commit 7bfb915a597a301abb892f620fe5c283a9fdbd77.

This commit broke pxa and omap-serial, because it inhibited them from
calling stop_tx() if their TX FIFOs weren't completely empty. This
resulted in these two drivers hanging during transmits because the TX
interrupt would stay enabled, and a new TX interrupt would never fire.
