Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: drop bogus DP PHY clock

From: Johan Hovold <johan+linaro@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit bb9f23e46ddcebe1bc68a43a0f7acfc1865a6472 ]

The QMP pipe clock is used by the USB part of the PHY so drop the
corresponding properties from the DP child node.

Fixes: 5aa0d1becd5b ("arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: switch usb1 qmp phy to USB3+DP mode")
