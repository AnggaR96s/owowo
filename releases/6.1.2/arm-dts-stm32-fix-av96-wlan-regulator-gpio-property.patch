Subject: ARM: dts: stm32: Fix AV96 WLAN regulator gpio property

From: Marek Vasut <marex@denx.de>

[ Upstream commit d5d577e3d50713ad11d98dbdaa48bb494346c26d ]

The WLAN regulator uses 'gpios' property instead of 'gpio' to specify
regulator enable GPIO. While the former is also currently handled by
the Linux kernel regulator-fixed driver, the later is the correct one
per DT bindings. Update the DT to use the later.

Fixes: 7dd5cbba42c93 ("ARM: dts: stm32: Enable WiFi on AV96")
