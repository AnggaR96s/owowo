Subject: scsi: megaraid_sas: Update controller info during resume

From: Shivasharan S <shivasharan.srikanteshwara@broadcom.com>

[ Upstream commit c3b10a55abc943a526aaecd7e860b15671beb906 ]

There is a possibility that firmware on the controller was upgraded before
system was suspended. During resume, driver needs to read updated
controller properties.
