Subject: ARC: perf: map generic branches to correct hardware condition

From: Eugeniy Paltsev <Eugeniy.Paltsev@synopsys.com>

commit 3affbf0e154ee351add6fcc254c59c3f3947fa8f upstream.

So far we've mapped branches to "ijmp" which also counts conditional
branches NOT taken. This makes us different from other architectures
such as ARM which seem to be counting only taken branches.

So use "ijmptak" hardware condition which only counts (all jump
instructions that are taken)

'ijmptak' event is available on both ARCompact and ARCv2 ISA based
cores.
