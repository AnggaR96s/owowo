Subject: ucc_geth: Reset BQL queue when stopping device

From: Mathias Thore <mathias.thore@infinera.com>

[ Upstream commit e15aa3b2b1388c399c1a2ce08550d2cc4f7e3e14 ]

After a timeout event caused by for example a broadcast storm, when
the MAC and PHY are reset, the BQL TX queue needs to be reset as
well. Otherwise, the device will exhibit severe performance issues
even after the storm has ended.
