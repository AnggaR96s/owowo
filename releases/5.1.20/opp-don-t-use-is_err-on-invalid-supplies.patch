Subject: opp: Don't use IS_ERR on invalid supplies

From: Dmitry Osipenko <digetx@gmail.com>

commit 560d1bcad715c215e7ffe5d7cffe045974b623d0 upstream.

_set_opp_custom() receives a set of OPP supplies as its arguments and
the caller of it passes NULL when the supplies are not valid. But
_set_opp_custom(), by mistake, checks for error by performing
IS_ERR(old_supply) on it which will always evaluate to false.

The problem was spotted during of testing of upcoming update for the
NVIDIA Tegra CPUFreq driver.
