Subject: mtd: rawnand: mtk: Correct low level time calculation of r/w cycle

From: Xiaolei Li <xiaolei.li@mediatek.com>

commit e1884ffddacc0424d7e785e6f8087bd12f7196db upstream.

At present, the flow of calculating AC timing of read/write cycle in SDR
mode is that:
At first, calculate high hold time which is valid for both read and write
cycle using the max value between tREH_min and tWH_min.
Secondly, calculate WE# pulse width using tWP_min.
Thridly, calculate RE# pulse width using the bigger one between tREA_max
and tRP_min.

But NAND SPEC shows that Controller should also meet write/read cycle time.
That is write cycle time should be more than tWC_min and read cycle should
be more than tRC_min. Obviously, we do not achieve that now.

This patch corrects the low level time calculation to meet minimum
read/write cycle time required. After getting the high hold time, WE# low
level time will be promised to meet tWP_min and tWC_min requirement,
and RE# low level time will be promised to meet tREA_max, tRP_min and
tRC_min requirement.
