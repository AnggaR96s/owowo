Subject: ARM: dts: rockchip: add power-domains property to dp node on rk3288

From: Johan Jonker <jbx6244@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 80422339a75088322b4d3884bd12fa0fe5d11050 ]

The clocks in the Rockchip rk3288 DisplayPort node are
included in the power-domain@RK3288_PD_VIO logic, but the
power-domains property in the dp node is missing, so fix it.
