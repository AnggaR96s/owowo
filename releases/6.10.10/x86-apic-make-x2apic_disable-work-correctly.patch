Subject: x86/apic: Make x2apic_disable() work correctly

From: Yuntao Wang <yuntao.wang@linux.dev>

commit 0ecc5be200c84e67114f3640064ba2bae3ba2f5a upstream.

x2apic_disable() clears x2apic_state and x2apic_mode unconditionally, even
when the state is X2APIC_ON_LOCKED, which prevents the kernel to disable
it thereby creating inconsistent state.

Due to the early state check for X2APIC_ON, the code path which warns about
a locked X2APIC cannot be reached.

Test for state < X2APIC_ON instead and move the clearing of the state and
mode variables to the place which actually disables X2APIC.

[ tglx: Massaged change log. Added Fixes tag. Moved clearing so it's at the
  	right place for back ports ]

Fixes: a57e456a7b28 ("x86/apic: Fix fallout from x2apic cleanup")
