Subject: x86/speculation: Fill RSB on vmexit for IBRS
To: <stable@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: <surajjs@amazon.com>, <sjitindarsingh@gmail.com>, <cascardo@canonical.com>, <kvm@vger.kernel.org>, <pbonzini@redhat.com>, <jpoimboe@kernel.org>, <peterz@infradead.org>, <x86@kernel.org>
Message-ID: <20221027205533.17873-3-surajjs@amazon.com>

From: Josh Poimboeuf <jpoimboe@kernel.org>

commit 9756bba28470722dacb79ffce554336dd1f6a6cd upstream.

Prevent RSB underflow/poisoning attacks with RSB.  While at it, add a
bunch of comments to attempt to document the current state of tribal
knowledge about RSB attacks and what exactly is being mitigated.
