Subject: platform/x86: asus-wmi: Fix keyboard brightness cannot be set to 0

From: Jian-Hong Pan <jian-hong@endlessm.com>

commit 176a7fca81c5090a7240664e3002c106d296bf31 upstream.

Some of ASUS laptops like UX431FL keyboard backlight cannot be set to
brightness 0. According to ASUS' information, the brightness should be
0x80 ~ 0x83. This patch fixes it by following the logic.
