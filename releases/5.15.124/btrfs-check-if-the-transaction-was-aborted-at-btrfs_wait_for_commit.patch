Subject: btrfs: check if the transaction was aborted at btrfs_wait_for_commit()

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

commit bf7ecbe9875061bf3fce1883e3b26b77f847d1e8 upstream.

At btrfs_wait_for_commit() we wait for a transaction to finish and then
always return 0 (success) without checking if it was aborted, in which
case the transaction didn't happen due to some critical error. Fix this
by checking if the transaction was aborted.

Fixes: 462045928bda ("Btrfs: add START_SYNC, WAIT_SYNC ioctls")
