Subject: net/mlx5: Fix fw tracer first block check

From: Moshe Shemesh <moshe@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit 4261edf11cb7c9224af713a102e5616329306932 ]

While handling new traces, to verify it is not the first block being
written, last_timestamp is checked. But instead of checking it is non
zero it is verified to be zero. Fix to verify last_timestamp is not
zero.
