Subject: btrfs: free data reloc tree on failed mount

From: Josef Bacik <josef@toxicpanda.com>

commit 9e3aa8054453d23d9f477f0cdae70a6a1ea6ec8a upstream.

While testing a weird problem with -o degraded, I noticed I was getting
leaked root errors

  BTRFS warning (device loop0): writable mount is not allowed due to too many missing devices
  BTRFS error (device loop0): open_ctree failed
  BTRFS error (device loop0): leaked root -9-0 refcount 1

This is the DATA_RELOC root, which gets read before the other fs roots,
but is included in the fs roots radix tree.  Handle this by adding a
btrfs_drop_and_free_fs_root() on the data reloc root if it exists.  This
is ok to do here if we fail further up because we will only drop the ref
if we delete the root from the radix tree, and all other cleanup won't
be duplicated.
