From: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>

commit 734009e96d1983ad739e5b656e03430b3660c913 upstream.

This patch comes directly from an origin patch (commit
dc3f2ff11740159080f2e8e359ae0ab57c8e74b6) in v4.9.

Currently futex-pi relies on hb->lock to serialize everything. But hb->lock
creates another set of problems, especially priority inversions on RT where
hb->lock becomes a rt_mutex itself.

The rt_mutex::wait_lock is the most obvious protection for keeping the
futex user space value and the kernel internal pi_state in sync.

Rework and document the locking so rt_mutex::wait_lock is held accross all
operations which modify the user space value and the pi state.

This allows to invoke rt_mutex_unlock() (including deboost) without holding
hb->lock as a next step.

Nothing yet relies on the new locking rules.
