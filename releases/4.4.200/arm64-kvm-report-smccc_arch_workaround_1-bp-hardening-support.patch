Subject: arm64: KVM: Report SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 BP hardening support
To: stable@vger.kernel.org
Cc: linus.walleij@linaro.org, rmk+kernel@armlinux.org.uk, Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>, Ard Biesheuvel <ardb@kernel.org>
Message-ID: <20191108123554.29004-10-ardb@kernel.org>

From: Marc Zyngier <marc.zyngier@arm.com>

commit 6167ec5c9145cdf493722dfd80a5d48bafc4a18a upstream.

A new feature of SMCCC 1.1 is that it offers firmware-based CPU
workarounds. In particular, SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 provides
BP hardening for CVE-2017-5715.

If the host has some mitigation for this issue, report that
we deal with it using SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1, as we apply the
host workaround on every guest exit.
