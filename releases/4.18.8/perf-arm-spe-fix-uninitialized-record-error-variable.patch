Subject: perf arm spe: Fix uninitialized record error variable

From: Kim Phillips <kim.phillips@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit 344353366591acf659a0d0dea498611da78d67e2 ]

The auxtrace init variable 'err' was not being initialized, leading perf
to abort early in an SPE record command when there was no explicit
error, rather only based whatever memory contents were on the stack.
Initialize it explicitly on getting an SPE successfully, the same way
cs-etm does.
