Subject: NIOS2: fix kconfig unmet dependency warning for SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE

From: Randy Dunlap <rdunlap@infradead.org>

[ Upstream commit adfc8f9d2f9fefd880abc82cfbf62cbfe6539c97 ]

SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE depends on TTY so EARLY_PRINTK should also
depend on TTY so that it does not select SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
inadvertently.

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
  Depends on [n]: TTY [=n] && HAS_IOMEM [=y]
  Selected by [y]:
  - EARLY_PRINTK [=y]

Fixes: e8bf5bc776ed ("nios2: add early printk support")
