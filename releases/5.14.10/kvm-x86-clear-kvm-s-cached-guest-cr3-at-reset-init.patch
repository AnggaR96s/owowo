Subject: KVM: x86: Clear KVM's cached guest CR3 at RESET/INIT

From: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

commit 03a6e84069d1870f5b3d360e64cb330b66f76dee upstream.

Explicitly zero the guest's CR3 and mark it available+dirty at RESET/INIT.
Per Intel's SDM and AMD's APM, CR3 is zeroed at both RESET and INIT.  For
RESET, this is a nop as vcpu is zero-allocated.  For INIT, the bug has
likely escaped notice because no firmware/kernel puts its page tables root
at PA=0, let alone relies on INIT to get the desired CR3 for such page
tables.
