Subject: ARM: dts: rockchip: Make rk3288-veyron-minnie run at hs200

[ Upstream commit 1c0479023412ab7834f2e98b796eb0d8c627cd62 ]

As some point hs200 was failing on rk3288-veyron-minnie.  See commit
984926781122 ("ARM: dts: rockchip: temporarily remove emmc hs200 speed
from rk3288 minnie").  Although I didn't track down exactly when it
started working, it seems to work OK now, so let's turn it back on.

To test this, I booted from SD card and then used this script to
stress the enumeration process after fixing a memory leak [1]:
  cd /sys/bus/platform/drivers/dwmmc_rockchip
  for i in $(seq 1 3000); do
    echo "========================" $i
    echo ff0f0000.dwmmc > unbind
    sleep .5
    echo ff0f0000.dwmmc > bind
    while true; do
      if [ -e /dev/mmcblk2 ]; then
        break;
      fi
      sleep .1
    done
  done

It worked fine.
