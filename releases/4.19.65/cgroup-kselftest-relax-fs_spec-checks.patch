Subject: cgroup: kselftest: relax fs_spec checks

From: Chris Down <chris@chrisdown.name>

commit b59b1baab789eacdde809135542e3d4f256f6878 upstream.

On my laptop most memcg kselftests were being skipped because it claimed
cgroup v2 hierarchy wasn't mounted, but this isn't correct.  Instead, it
seems current systemd HEAD mounts it with the name "cgroup2" instead of
"cgroup":

    % grep cgroup /proc/mounts
    cgroup2 /sys/fs/cgroup cgroup2 rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,nsdelegate 0 0

I can't think of a reason to need to check fs_spec explicitly
since it's arbitrary, so we can just rely on fs_vfstype.

After these changes, `make TARGETS=cgroup kselftest` actually runs the
cgroup v2 tests in more cases.
