Subject: drm/msm: fix use-after-free on probe deferral

From: Johan Hovold <johan+linaro@kernel.org>

commit 6808abdb33bf90330e70a687d29f038507e06ebb upstream.

The bridge counter was never reset when tearing down the DRM device so
that stale pointers to deallocated structures would be accessed on the
next tear down (e.g. after a second late bind deferral).

Given enough bridges and a few probe deferrals this could currently also
lead to data beyond the bridge array being corrupted.

Fixes: d28ea556267c ("drm/msm: properly add and remove internal bridges")
Fixes: a3376e3ec81c ("drm/msm: convert to drm_bridge")
