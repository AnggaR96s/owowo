Subject: KVM: s390: Do not report unusabled IDs via KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPU_ID

From: Thomas Huth <thuth@redhat.com>

commit a86cb413f4bf273a9d341a3ab2c2ca44e12eb317 upstream.

KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPU_ID is currently always reporting KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID on all
architectures. However, on s390x, the amount of usable CPUs is determined
during runtime - it is depending on the features of the machine the code
is running on. Since we are using the vcpu_id as an index into the SCA
structures that are defined by the hardware (see e.g. the sca_add_vcpu()
function), it is not only the amount of CPUs that is limited by the hard-
ware, but also the range of IDs that we can use.
Thus KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPU_ID must be determined during runtime on s390x, too.
So the handling of KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPU_ID has to be moved from the common
code into the architecture specific code, and on s390x we have to return
the same value here as for KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPUS.
This problem has been discovered with the kvm_create_max_vcpus selftest.
With this change applied, the selftest now passes on s390x, too.
