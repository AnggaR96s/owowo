Subject: firmware: arm_ffa: Set handle field to zero in memory descriptor

From: Balint Dobszay <balint.dobszay@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit 3aa0519a4780f1b8e11966bd879d4a2934ba455f ]

As described in the commit 111a833dc5cb ("firmware: arm_ffa: Set
reserved/MBZ fields to zero in the memory descriptors") some fields in
the memory descriptor have to be zeroed explicitly. The handle field is
one of these, but it was left out from that change, fix this now.
