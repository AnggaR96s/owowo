Subject: cifs: avoid redundant calls to disable multichannel

From: Shyam Prasad N <sprasad@microsoft.com>

[ Upstream commit e77e15fa5eb1c830597c5ca53ea7af973bae2f78 ]

When the server reports query network interface info call
as unsupported following a tree connect, it means that
multichannel is unsupported, even if the server capabilities
report otherwise.

When this happens, cifs_chan_skip_or_disable is called to
disable multichannel on the client. However, we only need
to call this when multichannel is currently setup.

Fixes: f591062bdbf4 ("cifs: handle servers that still advertise multichannel after disabling")
