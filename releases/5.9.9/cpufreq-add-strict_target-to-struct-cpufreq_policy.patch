Subject: cpufreq: Add strict_target to struct cpufreq_policy

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

commit ea9364bbadf11f0c55802cf11387d74f524cee84 upstream.

Add a new field to be set when the CPUFREQ_GOV_STRICT_TARGET flag is
set for the current governor to struct cpufreq_policy, so that the
drivers needing to check CPUFREQ_GOV_STRICT_TARGET do not have to
access the governor object during every frequency transition.
