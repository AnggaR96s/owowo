Subject: net/mlx5e: IPoIB, Don't allow CQE compression to be turned on by
 default

From: Dragos Tatulea <dtatulea@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit b12d581e83e3ae1080c32ab83f123005bd89a840 ]

mlx5e_build_nic_params will turn CQE compression on if the hardware
capability is enabled and the slow_pci_heuristic condition is detected.
As IPoIB doesn't support CQE compression, make sure to disable the
feature in the IPoIB profile init.

Please note that the feature is not exposed to the user for IPoIB
interfaces, so it can't be subsequently turned on.

Fixes: b797a684b0dd ("net/mlx5e: Enable CQE compression when PCI is slower than link")
