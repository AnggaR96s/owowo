Subject: mm: prevent page_frag_alloc() from corrupting the memory

From: Maurizio Lombardi <mlombard@redhat.com>

commit dac22531bbd4af2426c4e29e05594415ccfa365d upstream.

A number of drivers call page_frag_alloc() with a fragment's size >
PAGE_SIZE.

In low memory conditions, __page_frag_cache_refill() may fail the order
3 cache allocation and fall back to order 0; In this case, the cache
will be smaller than the fragment, causing memory corruptions.

Prevent this from happening by checking if the newly allocated cache is
large enough for the fragment; if not, the allocation will fail and
page_frag_alloc() will return NULL.
