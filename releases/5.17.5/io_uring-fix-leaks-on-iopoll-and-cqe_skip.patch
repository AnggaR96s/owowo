Subject: io_uring: fix leaks on IOPOLL and CQE_SKIP

From: Pavel Begunkov <asml.silence@gmail.com>

commit c0713540f6d55c53dca65baaead55a5a8b20552d upstream.

If all completed requests in io_do_iopoll() were marked with
REQ_F_CQE_SKIP, we'll not only skip CQE posting but also
io_free_batch_list() leaking memory and resources.

Move @nr_events increment before REQ_F_CQE_SKIP check. We'll potentially
return the value greater than the real one, but iopolling will deal with
it and the userspace will re-iopoll if needed. In anyway, I don't think
there are many use cases for REQ_F_CQE_SKIP + IOPOLL.

Fixes: 83a13a4181b0e ("io_uring: tweak iopoll CQE_SKIP event counting")
