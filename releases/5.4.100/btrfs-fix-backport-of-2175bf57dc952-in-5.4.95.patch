From: David Sterba <dsterba@suse.cz>

There's a mistake in backport of upstream commit 2175bf57dc95 ("btrfs:
fix possible free space tree corruption with online conversion") as
5.4.95 commit e1ae9aab8029.

The enum value BTRFS_FS_FREE_SPACE_TREE_UNTRUSTED has been added to the
wrong enum set, colliding with value of BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLE. This
could cause problems during the tree conversion, where the quotas
wouldn't be set up properly but the related code executed anyway due to
the bit set.

This is same fix that went to 5.10.x, with refreshed diff so it applies
cleanly on 5.4.x and with updated references.
