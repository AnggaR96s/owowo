Subject: bpf: fix up selftests after backports were fixed
To: <stable@vger.kernel.org>
Cc: <bpf@vger.kernel.org>, <samjonas@amazon.com>
Message-ID: <20210501180506.19154-3-fllinden@amazon.com>

From: Frank van der Linden <fllinden@amazon.com>

After the backport of the changes to fix CVE 2019-7308, the
selftests also need to be fixed up, as was done originally
in mainline 80c9b2fae87b ("bpf: add various test cases to selftests").

4.14 commit 03f11a51a19 ("bpf: Fix selftests are changes for CVE 2019-7308")
did that, but since there was an error in the backport, some
selftests did not change output. So, add them now that this error
has been fixed, and their output has actually changed as expected.

This adds the rest of the changed test outputs from 80c9b2fae87b.

Fixes: 03f11a51a19 ("bpf: Fix selftests are changes for CVE 2019-7308")
