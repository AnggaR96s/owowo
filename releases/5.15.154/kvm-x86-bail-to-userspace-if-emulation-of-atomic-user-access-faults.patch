Subject: KVM: x86: Bail to userspace if emulation of atomic user access faults

From: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

commit 5d6c7de6446e9ab3fb41d6f7d82770e50998f3de upstream.

Exit to userspace when emulating an atomic guest access if the CMPXCHG on
the userspace address faults.  Emulating the access as a write and thus
likely treating it as emulated MMIO is wrong, as KVM has already
confirmed there is a valid, writable memslot.
