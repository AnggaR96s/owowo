Subject: bnxt_en: Fix TC queue mapping.

From: Michael Chan <michael.chan@broadcom.com>

[ Upstream commit 18e4960c18f484ac288f41b43d0e6c4c88e6ea78 ]

The driver currently only calls netdev_set_tc_queue when the number of
TCs is greater than 1.  Instead, the comparison should be greater than
or equal to 1.  Even with 1 TC, we need to set the queue mapping.

This bug can cause warnings when the number of TCs is changed back to 1.

Fixes: 7809592d3e2e ("bnxt_en: Enable MSIX early in bnxt_init_one().")
