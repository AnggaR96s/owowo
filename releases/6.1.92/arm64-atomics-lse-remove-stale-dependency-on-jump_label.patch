Subject: arm64: atomics: lse: remove stale dependency on JUMP_LABEL

From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

commit 657eef0a5420a02c02945ed8c87f2ddcbd255772 upstream.

Currently CONFIG_ARM64_USE_LSE_ATOMICS depends upon CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL,
as the inline atomics were indirected with a static branch.

However, since commit:

  21fb26bfb01ffe0d ("arm64: alternatives: add alternative_has_feature_*()")

... we use an alternative_branch (which is always available) rather than
a static branch, and hence the dependency is unnecessary.

Remove the stale dependency, along with the stale include. This will
allow the use of LSE atomics in kernels built with CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL=n,
and reduces the risk of circular header dependencies via <asm/lse.h>.
