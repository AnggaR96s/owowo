Subject: riscv: Allow PROT_WRITE-only mmap()

From: Andrew Bresticker <abrestic@rivosinc.com>

commit 9e2e6042a7ec6504fe8e366717afa2f40cf16488 upstream.

Commit 2139619bcad7 ("riscv: mmap with PROT_WRITE but no PROT_READ is
invalid") made mmap() return EINVAL if PROT_WRITE was set wihtout
PROT_READ with the justification that a write-only PTE is considered a
reserved PTE permission bit pattern in the privileged spec. This check
is unnecessary since we let VM_WRITE imply VM_READ on RISC-V, and it is
inconsistent with other architectures that don't support write-only PTEs,
creating a potential software portability issue. Just remove the check
altogether and let PROT_WRITE imply PROT_READ as is the case on other
architectures.

Note that this also allows PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC mappings which were
disallowed prior to the aforementioned commit; PROT_READ is implied in
such mappings as well.
