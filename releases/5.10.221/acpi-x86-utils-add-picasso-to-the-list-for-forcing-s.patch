Subject: ACPI: x86: utils: Add Picasso to the list for forcing StorageD3Enable

From: Mario Limonciello <mario.limonciello@amd.com>

[ Upstream commit 10b6b4a8ac6120ec36555fd286eed577f7632e3b ]

Picasso was the first APU that introduced s2idle support from AMD,
and it was predating before vendors started to use `StorageD3Enable`
in their firmware.

Windows doesn't have problems with this hardware and NVME so it was
likely on the list of hardcoded CPUs to use this behavior in Windows.

Add it to the list for Linux to avoid NVME resume issues.
