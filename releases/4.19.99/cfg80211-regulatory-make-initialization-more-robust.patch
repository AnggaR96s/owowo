Subject: cfg80211: regulatory: make initialization more robust

From: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 71e5e886806ee3f8e0c44ed945eb2e4d6659c6e3 ]

Since my change to split out the regulatory init to occur later,
any issues during earlier cfg80211_init() or errors during the
platform device allocation would lead to crashes later. Make this
more robust by checking that the earlier initialization succeeded.

Fixes: d7be102f2945 ("cfg80211: initialize regulatory keys/database later")
