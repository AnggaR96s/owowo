Subject: arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Add missing PIO clocks

From: Maxime Ripard <maxime.ripard@bootlin.com>

[ Upstream commit 562bf19611c000cb7219431c3cc78aa60c2b371e ]

The pinctrl binding mandates that we have the three clocks fed into the PIO
described.

Even though the old case is still supported for backward compatibility, we
should update our DTs to fix this.

Fixes: 6bc37fac30cf ("arm64: dts: add Allwinner A64 SoC .dtsi")
