Subject: clk: actions: Fix factor clk struct member access

From: Manivannan Sadhasivam <manivannan.sadhasivam@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit ed309bfb4812e8b31a3eb877e157b8028a49e50c ]

Since the helper "owl_factor_helper_round_rate" is shared between factor
and composite clocks, using the factor clk specific helper function
like "hw_to_owl_factor" to access its members will create issues when
called from composite clk specific code. Hence, pass the "factor_hw"
struct pointer directly instead of fetching it using factor clk specific
helpers.

This issue has been observed when a composite clock like "sd0_clk" tried
to call "owl_factor_helper_round_rate" resulting in pointer dereferencing
error.

While we are at it, let's rename the "clk_val_best" function to
"owl_clk_val_best" since this is an owl SoCs specific helper.
