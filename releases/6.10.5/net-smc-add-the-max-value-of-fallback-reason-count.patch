Subject: net/smc: add the max value of fallback reason count

From: Zhengchao Shao <shaozhengchao@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit d27a835f41d947f62e6a95e89ba523299c9e6437 ]

The number of fallback reasons defined in the smc_clc.h file has reached
36. For historical reasons, some are no longer quoted, and there's 33
actually in use. So, add the max value of fallback reason count to 36.

Fixes: 6ac1e6563f59 ("net/smc: support smc v2.x features validate")
Fixes: 7f0620b9940b ("net/smc: support max connections per lgr negotiation")
Fixes: 69b888e3bb4b ("net/smc: support max links per lgr negotiation in clc handshake")
