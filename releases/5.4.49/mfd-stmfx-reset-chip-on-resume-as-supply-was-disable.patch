Subject: mfd: stmfx: Reset chip on resume as supply was disabled

From: Amelie Delaunay <amelie.delaunay@st.com>

[ Upstream commit e583649d87ec090444aa5347af0927cd6e8581ae ]

STMFX supply is disabled during suspend. To avoid a too early access to
the STMFX firmware on resume, reset the chip and wait for its firmware to
be loaded.

Fixes: 06252ade9156 ("mfd: Add ST Multi-Function eXpander (STMFX) core driver")
