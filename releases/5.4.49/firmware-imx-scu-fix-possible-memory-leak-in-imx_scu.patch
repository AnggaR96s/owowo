Subject: firmware: imx: scu: Fix possible memory leak in imx_scu_probe()

From: Wei Yongjun <weiyongjun1@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit 89f12d6509bff004852c51cb713a439a86816b24 ]

'chan_name' is malloced in imx_scu_probe() and should be freed
before leaving from the error handling cases, otherwise it will
cause memory leak.

Fixes: edbee095fafb ("firmware: imx: add SCU firmware driver support")
