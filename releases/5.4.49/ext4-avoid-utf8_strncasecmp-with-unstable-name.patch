Subject: ext4: avoid utf8_strncasecmp() with unstable name

From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

commit 2ce3ee931a097e9720310db3f09c01c825a4580c upstream.

If the dentry name passed to ->d_compare() fits in dentry::d_iname, then
it may be concurrently modified by a rename.  This can cause undefined
behavior (possibly out-of-bounds memory accesses or crashes) in
utf8_strncasecmp(), since fs/unicode/ isn't written to handle strings
that may be concurrently modified.

Fix this by first copying the filename to a stack buffer if needed.
This way we get a stable snapshot of the filename.

Fixes: b886ee3e778e ("ext4: Support case-insensitive file name lookups")
