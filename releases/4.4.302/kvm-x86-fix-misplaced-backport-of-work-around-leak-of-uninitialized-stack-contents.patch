Subject: KVM: x86: Fix misplaced backport of "work around leak of uninitialized stack contents"
To: gregkh@linuxfoundation.org

From: Guillaume Bertholon <guillaume.bertholon@ens.fr>

The upstream commit 541ab2aeb282 ("KVM: x86: work around leak of
uninitialized stack contents") resets `exception` in the function
`kvm_write_guest_virt_system`.
However, its backported version in stable (commit ba7f1c934f2e
("KVM: x86: work around leak of uninitialized stack contents")) applied
the change in `emulator_write_std` instead.

This patch moves the memset instruction back to
`kvm_write_guest_virt_system`.
