Commit 2aa6d036b716 ("mm: numa: avoid waiting on freed migrated pages")
was an incomplete backport of the upstream commit.  It is necessary to
always reset page_nid before attempting any early exit.

The original commit conflicted due to lack of commit 82b0f8c39a38
("mm: join struct fault_env and vm_fault") in 4.9 so it wasn't a clean
application, and the change must have just gotten lost in the noise.
