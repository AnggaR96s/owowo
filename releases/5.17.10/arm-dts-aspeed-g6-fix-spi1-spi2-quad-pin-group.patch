Subject: ARM: dts: aspeed-g6: fix SPI1/SPI2 quad pin group

From: Jae Hyun Yoo <quic_jaehyoo@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit 890362d41b244536ab63591f813393f5fdf59ed7 ]

Fix incorrect function mappings in pinctrl_qspi1_default and
pinctrl_qspi2_default since their function should be SPI1 and
SPI2 respectively.

Fixes: f510f04c8c83 ("ARM: dts: aspeed: Add AST2600 pinmux nodes")
