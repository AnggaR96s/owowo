Subject: fbdev: Prevent possible use-after-free in fb_release()

From: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>

[ Upstream commit 89bfd4017e58faaf70411555e7f508495114e90b ]

Most fbdev drivers have issues with the fb_info lifetime, because call to
framebuffer_release() from their driver's .remove callback, rather than
doing from fbops.fb_destroy callback.

Doing that will destroy the fb_info too early, while references to it may
still exist, leading to a use-after-free error.

To prevent this, check the fb_info reference counter when attempting to
kfree the data structure in framebuffer_release(). That will leak it but
at least will prevent the mentioned error.
