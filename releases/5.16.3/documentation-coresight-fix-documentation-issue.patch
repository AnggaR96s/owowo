Subject: Documentation: coresight: Fix documentation issue

From: Mike Leach <mike.leach@linaro.org>

commit 66bd1333abd7fa191f13b929c9119d6cd3df27b0 upstream.

Fix the description of the directories and attributes used
in cs_etm as used by perf.

Drop the references to the 'configurations' sub-directory which
had been removed in an earlier version of the patchset.
