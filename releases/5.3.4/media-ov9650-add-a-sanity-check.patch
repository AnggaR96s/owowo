Subject: media: ov9650: add a sanity check

From: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 093347abc7a4e0490e3c962ecbde2dc272a8f708 ]

As pointed by cppcheck:

	[drivers/media/i2c/ov9650.c:706]: (error) Shifting by a negative value is undefined behaviour
	[drivers/media/i2c/ov9650.c:707]: (error) Shifting by a negative value is undefined behaviour
	[drivers/media/i2c/ov9650.c:721]: (error) Shifting by a negative value is undefined behaviour

Prevent mangling with gains with invalid values.

As pointed by Sylvester, this should never happen in practice,
as min value of V4L2_CID_GAIN control is 16 (gain is always >= 16
and m is always >= 0), but it is too hard for a static analyzer
to get this, as the logic with validates control min/max is
elsewhere inside V4L2 core.
