Subject: dm integrity: flush the journal on suspend

From: Mikulas Patocka <mpatocka@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 5e5dab5ec763d600fe0a67837dd9155bdc42f961 ]

This commit flushes the journal on suspend. It is prerequisite for the
next commit that enables activating dm integrity devices in read-only mode.

Note that we deliberately didn't flush the journal on suspend, so that the
journal replay code would be tested. However, the dm-integrity code is 5
years old now, so that journal replay is well-tested, and we can make this
change now.
