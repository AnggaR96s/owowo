Subject: userns; Correct the comment in map_write

From: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>

commit 36476beac4f8ca9dc7722790b2e8ef0e8e51034e upstream.

It is important that all maps are less than PAGE_SIZE
or else setting the last byte of the buffer to '0'
could write off the end of the allocated storage.

Correct the misleading comment.
