Subject: s390/qdio: add sanity checks to the fast-requeue path

[ Upstream commit a6ec414a4dd529eeac5c3ea51c661daba3397108 ]

If the device driver were to send out a full queue's worth of SBALs,
current code would end up discovering the last of those SBALs as PRIMED
and erroneously skip the SIGA-w. This immediately stalls the queue.

Add a check to not attempt fast-requeue in this case. While at it also
make sure that the state of the previous SBAL was successfully extracted
before inspecting it.
