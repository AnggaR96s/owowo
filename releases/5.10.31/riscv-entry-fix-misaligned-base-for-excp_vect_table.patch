Subject: riscv,entry: fix misaligned base for excp_vect_table

From: Zihao Yu <yuzihao@ict.ac.cn>

[ Upstream commit ac8d0b901f0033b783156ab2dc1a0e73ec42409b ]

In RV64, the size of each entry in excp_vect_table is 8 bytes. If the
base of the table is not 8-byte aligned, loading an entry in the table
will raise a misaligned exception. Although such exception will be
handled by opensbi/bbl, this still causes performance degradation.
