Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc8180x: Fix LLCC reg property

From: Bjorn Andersson <quic_bjorande@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit 74cf6675c35ec3034053a69926f4d98e52852eb0 ]

The LLCC binding and driver was recently corrected to handle the stride
varying between platforms. Switch to the new format to ensure accesses
are done in the right place.

Fixes: 8575f197b077 ("arm64: dts: qcom: Introduce the SC8180x platform")
