Subject: KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't take kvm->lock around kvm_for_each_vcpu

[ Upstream commit 5a3f49364c3ffa1107bd88f8292406e98c5d206c ]

Currently the HV KVM code takes the kvm->lock around calls to
kvm_for_each_vcpu() and kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() (which can call
kvm_for_each_vcpu() internally).  However, that leads to a lock
order inversion problem, because these are called in contexts where
the vcpu mutex is held, but the vcpu mutexes nest within kvm->lock
according to Documentation/virtual/kvm/locking.txt.  Hence there
is a possibility of deadlock.

To fix this, we simply don't take the kvm->lock mutex around these
calls.  This is safe because the implementations of kvm_for_each_vcpu()
and kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() have been designed to be able to be called
locklessly.
