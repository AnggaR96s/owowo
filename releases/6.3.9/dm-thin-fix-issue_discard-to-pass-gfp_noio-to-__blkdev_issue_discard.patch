Subject: dm thin: fix issue_discard to pass GFP_NOIO to __blkdev_issue_discard

From: Mike Snitzer <snitzer@kernel.org>

commit 722d90822321497e2837cfc9000202e256e6b32f upstream.

issue_discard() passes GFP_NOWAIT to __blkdev_issue_discard() despite
its code assuming bio_alloc() always succeeds.

Commit 3dba53a958a75 ("dm thin: use __blkdev_issue_discard for async
discard support") clearly shows where things went bad:

Before commit 3dba53a958a75, dm-thin.c's open-coded
__blkdev_issue_discard_async() properly handled using GFP_NOWAIT.
Unfortunately __blkdev_issue_discard() doesn't and it was missed
during review.
