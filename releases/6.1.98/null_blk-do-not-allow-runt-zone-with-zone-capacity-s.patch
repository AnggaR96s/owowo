Subject: null_blk: Do not allow runt zone with zone capacity smaller then zone
 size

From: Damien Le Moal <dlemoal@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit b164316808ec5de391c3e7b0148ec937d32d280d ]

A zoned device with a smaller last zone together with a zone capacity
smaller than the zone size does make any sense as that does not
correspond to any possible setup for a real device:
1) For ZNS and zoned UFS devices, all zones are always the same size.
2) For SMR HDDs, all zones always have the same capacity.
In other words, if we have a smaller last runt zone, then this zone
capacity should always be equal to the zone size.

Add a check in null_init_zoned_dev() to prevent a configuration to have
both a smaller zone size and a zone capacity smaller than the zone size.
