From: Masami Hiramatsu <mhiramat@kernel.org>

This reverts commit 77fa5e15c933a1ec812de61ad709c00aa51e96ae.

Since the upstream commit e792ff804f49720ce003b3e4c618b5d996256a18
depends on the generic kretprobe trampoline handler, which was
introduced by commit 66ada2ccae4e ("kprobes: Add generic kretprobe
trampoline handler") but that is not ported to the stable kernel
because it is not a bugfix series.
So revert this commit to fix a build error.

NOTE: I keep commit a7fe2378454c ("ia64: kprobes: Fix to pass
correct trampoline address to the handler") on the tree, that seems
just a cleanup without the original reverted commit, but it would
be better to use dereference_function_descriptor() macro instead
of accessing descriptor's field directly.

Fixes: 77fa5e15c933 ("ia64: kprobes: Use generic kretprobe trampoline handler")
