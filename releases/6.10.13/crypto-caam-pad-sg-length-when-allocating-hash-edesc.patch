Subject: crypto: caam - Pad SG length when allocating hash edesc

From: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>

[ Upstream commit 5124bc96162667766f6120b19f57a640c2eccb2a ]

Because hardware will read in multiples of 4 SG entries, ensure
the allocated length is always padded.  This was already done
by some callers of ahash_edesc_alloc, but ahash_digest was conspicuously
missing.

In any case, doing it in the allocation function ensures that the
memory is always there.
