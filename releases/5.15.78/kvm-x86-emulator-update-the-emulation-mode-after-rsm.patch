Subject: KVM: x86: emulator: update the emulation mode after rsm

From: Maxim Levitsky <mlevitsk@redhat.com>

commit 055f37f84e304e59c046d1accfd8f08462f52c4c upstream.

Update the emulation mode after RSM so that RIP will be correctly
written back, because the RSM instruction can switch the CPU mode from
32 bit (or less) to 64 bit.

This fixes a guest crash in case the #SMI is received while the guest
runs a code from an address > 32 bit.
