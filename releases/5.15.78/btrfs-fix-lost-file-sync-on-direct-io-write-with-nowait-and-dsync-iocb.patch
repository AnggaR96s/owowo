Subject: btrfs: fix lost file sync on direct IO write with nowait and dsync iocb

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

commit 8184620ae21213d51eaf2e0bd4186baacb928172 upstream.

When doing a direct IO write using a iocb with nowait and dsync set, we
end up not syncing the file once the write completes.

This is because we tell iomap to not call generic_write_sync(), which
would result in calling btrfs_sync_file(), in order to avoid a deadlock
since iomap can call it while we are holding the inode's lock and
btrfs_sync_file() needs to acquire the inode's lock. The deadlock happens
only if the write happens synchronously, when iomap_dio_rw() calls
iomap_dio_complete() before it returns. Instead we do the sync ourselves
at btrfs_do_write_iter().

For a nowait write however we can end up not doing the sync ourselves at
at btrfs_do_write_iter() because the write could have been queued, and
therefore we get -EIOCBQUEUED returned from iomap in such case. That makes
us skip the sync call at btrfs_do_write_iter(), as we don't do it for
any error returned from btrfs_direct_write(). We can't simply do the call
even if -EIOCBQUEUED is returned, since that would block the task waiting
for IO, both for the data since there are bios still in progress as well
as potentially blocking when joining a log transaction and when syncing
the log (writing log trees, super blocks, etc).

So let iomap do the sync call itself and in order to avoid deadlocks for
the case of synchronous writes (without nowait), use __iomap_dio_rw() and
have ourselves call iomap_dio_complete() after unlocking the inode.

A test case will later be sent for fstests, after this is fixed in Linus'
tree.
