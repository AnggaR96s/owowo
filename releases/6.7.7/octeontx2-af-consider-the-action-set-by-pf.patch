Subject: octeontx2-af: Consider the action set by PF

From: Subbaraya Sundeep <sbhatta@marvell.com>

[ Upstream commit 3b1ae9b71c2a97f848b00fb085a2bd29bddbe8d9 ]

AF reserves MCAM entries for each PF, VF present in the
system and populates the entry with DMAC and action with
default RSS so that basic packet I/O works. Since PF/VF is
not aware of the RSS action installed by AF, AF only fixup
the actions of the rules installed by PF/VF with corresponding
default RSS action. This worked well for rules installed by
PF/VF for features like RX VLAN offload and DMAC filters but
rules involving action like drop/forward to queue are also
getting modified by AF. Hence fix it by setting the default
RSS action only if requested by PF/VF.

Fixes: 967db3529eca ("octeontx2-af: add support for multicast/promisc packet replication feature")
