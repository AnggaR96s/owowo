Subject: KVM: arm64: Fix caching of host MDCR_EL2 value

From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

commit da5a3ce66b8bb51b0ea8a89f42aac153903f90fb upstream.

At boot time, KVM stashes the host MDCR_EL2 value, but only does this
when the kernel is not running in hyp mode (i.e. is non-VHE). In these
cases, the stashed value of MDCR_EL2.HPMN happens to be zero, which can
lead to CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE behaviour.

Since we use this value to derive the MDCR_EL2 value when switching
to/from a guest, after a guest have been run, the performance counters
do not behave as expected. This has been observed to result in accesses
via PMXEVTYPER_EL0 and PMXEVCNTR_EL0 not affecting the relevant
counters, resulting in events not being counted. In these cases, only
the fixed-purpose cycle counter appears to work as expected.

Fix this by always stashing the host MDCR_EL2 value, regardless of VHE.
