Subject: arm: dts: mediatek: Add missing cooling device properties for CPUs

From: Viresh Kumar <viresh.kumar@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 0c7f7a5150023f3c6f0b27c4d4940ce3dfaf62cc ]

The cooling device properties, like "#cooling-cells" and
"dynamic-power-coefficient", should either be present for all the CPUs
of a cluster or none. If these are present only for a subset of CPUs of
a cluster then things will start falling apart as soon as the CPUs are
brought online in a different order. For example, this will happen
because the operating system looks for such properties in the CPU node
it is trying to bring up, so that it can register a cooling device.

Add such missing properties.
