Subject: vxlan: Don't call gro_cells_destroy() before device is unregistered

From: Zhiqiang Liu <liuzhiqiang26@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit cc4807bb609230d8959fd732b0bf3bd4c2de8eac ]

Commit ad6c9986bcb62 ("vxlan: Fix GRO cells race condition between
receive and link delete") fixed a race condition for the typical case a vxlan
device is dismantled from the current netns. But if a netns is dismantled,
vxlan_destroy_tunnels() is called to schedule a unregister_netdevice_queue()
of all the vxlan tunnels that are related to this netns.

In vxlan_destroy_tunnels(), gro_cells_destroy() is called and finished before
unregister_netdevice_queue(). This means that the gro_cells_destroy() call is
done too soon, for the same reasons explained in above commit.

So we need to fully respect the RCU rules, and thus must remove the
gro_cells_destroy() call or risk use after-free.
