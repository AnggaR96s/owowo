Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: fix i2c2 pinctrl-names property on
 anbernic-rg353p/v

From: Heiko Stuebner <heiko@sntech.de>

[ Upstream commit f94b934336e30cebae75d4fbe04a2109a3c8fdec ]

We want to control pins, not beer mugs, so rename pintctrl-names to the
expected pinctrl-names.

This was not affecting functionality, because the i2c2 controller
already had a set of pinctrl properties.

Fixes: 523adb553573 ("arm64: dts: rockchip: add Anbernic RG353P and RG503")
Fixes: 1e141cf12726 ("arm64: dts: rockchip: add Anbernic RG353V and RG353VS")
