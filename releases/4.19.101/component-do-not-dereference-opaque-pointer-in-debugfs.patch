Subject: component: do not dereference opaque pointer in debugfs

From: Lubomir Rintel <lkundrak@v3.sk>

commit ef9ffc1e5f1ac73ecd2fb3b70db2a3b2472ff2f7 upstream.

The match data does not have to be a struct device pointer, and indeed
very often is not. Attempt to treat it as such easily results in a
crash.

For the components that are not registered, we don't know which device
is missing. Once it it is there, we can use the struct component to get
the device and whether it's bound or not.

Fixes: 59e73854b5fd ('component: add debugfs support')
