Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180-trogdor-homestar: fully configure secondary
 I2S pins

From: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 59e787935cfe6f562fbb9117e2df4076eaf810d8 ]

The Trogdor Homestar DTSI adds additional GPIO52 pin to secondary I2S pins
("sec_mi2s_active") and configures it to "mi2s_1" function.

The Trogdor DTSI (which is included by Homestar) configures drive
strength and bias for all "sec_mi2s_active" pins, thus the intention was
to apply this configuration also to GPIO52 on Homestar.
