Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250-mtp: fix reset line polarity

From: Dmitry Torokhov <dmitry.torokhov@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 15d9fcbb3e6e8420c7d1ae331405780c5d9c1c25 ]

The driver for the codec, when resetting the chip, first drives the line
low, and then high. This means that the line is active low. Change the
annotation in the DTS accordingly.

Fixes: 36c9d012f193 ("arm64: dts: qcom: use GPIO flags for tlmm")
Fixes: 5a263cf629a8 ("arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250-mtp: Add wcd9380 audio codec node")
