Subject: watchdog/perf: properly initialize the turbo mode timestamp and rearm counter

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

commit f944ffcbc2e1c759764850261670586ddf3bdabb upstream.

For systems on which the performance counter can expire early due to turbo
modes the watchdog handler has a safety net in place which validates that
since the last watchdog event there has at least 4/5th of the watchdog
period elapsed.

This works reliably only after the first watchdog event because the per
CPU variable which holds the timestamp of the last event is never
initialized.

So a first spurious event will validate against a timestamp of 0 which
results in a delta which is likely to be way over the 4/5 threshold of the
period.  As this might happen before the first watchdog hrtimer event
increments the watchdog counter, this can lead to false positives.

Fix this by initializing the timestamp before enabling the hardware event.
Reset the rearm counter as well, as that might be non zero after the
watchdog was disabled and reenabled.
