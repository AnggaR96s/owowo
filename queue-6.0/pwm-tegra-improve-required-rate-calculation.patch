[ Upstream commit f271946117dde2ca8741b8138b347b2d68e6ad56 ]

For the case where dev_pm_opp_set_rate() is called to set the PWM clock
rate, the requested rate is calculated as ...

 required_clk_rate = (NSEC_PER_SEC / period_ns) << PWM_DUTY_WIDTH;

The above calculation may lead to rounding errors because the
NSEC_PER_SEC is divided by 'period_ns' before applying the
PWM_DUTY_WIDTH multiplication factor. For example, if the period is
45334ns, the above calculation yields a rate of 5646848Hz instead of
5646976Hz. Fix this by applying the multiplication factor before
dividing and using the DIV_ROUND_UP macro which yields the expected
result of 5646976Hz.
