Subject: thermal/drivers/qcom/temp-alarm: Fix inaccurate warning for gen2

From: Luca Weiss <luca.weiss@fairphone.com>

[ Upstream commit 8763f8acbf8aef22a2321d4c978cd078aa3b8f64 ]

On gen2 chips the stage2 threshold is not 140 degC but 125 degC.

Make the warning message clearer by using this variable and also by
including the temperature that was checked for.

Fixes: aa92b3310c55 ("thermal/drivers/qcom-spmi-temp-alarm: Add support for GEN2 rev 1 PMIC peripherals")
