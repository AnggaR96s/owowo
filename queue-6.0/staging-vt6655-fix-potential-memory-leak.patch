Subject: staging: vt6655: fix potential memory leak

From: Nam Cao <namcaov@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit c8ff91535880d41b49699b3829fb6151942de29e ]

In function device_init_td0_ring, memory is allocated for member
td_info of priv->apTD0Rings[i], with i increasing from 0. In case of
allocation failure, the memory is freed in reversed order, with i
decreasing to 0. However, the case i=0 is left out and thus memory is
leaked.

Modify the memory freeing loop to include the case i=0.
