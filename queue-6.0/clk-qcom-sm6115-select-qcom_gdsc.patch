Subject: clk: qcom: sm6115: Select QCOM_GDSC

From: Dang Huynh <danct12@riseup.net>

[ Upstream commit 50ee65dc512b9b5c4de354cf3b4dded34f46c571 ]

While working on the Fxtec Pro1X device, this error shows up with
my own minimal configuration:

gcc-sm6115: probe of 1400000.clock-controller failed with error -38

The clock driver depends on CONFIG_QCOM_GDSC and after enabling
that, the driver probes successfully.
