Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp-pmics: Remove reg entry & use correct node
 name for pmc8280c_lpg node

From: Bhupesh Sharma <bhupesh.sharma@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 7dac7991408f77b0b33ee5e6b729baa683889277 ]

Commit eeca7d46217c ("arm64: dts: qcom: pm8350c: Drop PWM reg declaration")
dropped PWM reg declaration for pm8350c pwm(s), but there is a leftover
'reg' entry inside the lpg/pwm node in sc8280xp dts file. Remove the same.

While at it, also remove the unused unit address in the node
label.

Also, since dt-bindings expect LPG/PWM node name to be "pwm",
use correct node name as well, to fix the following
error reported by 'make dtbs_check':

  'lpg' does not match any of the regexes
