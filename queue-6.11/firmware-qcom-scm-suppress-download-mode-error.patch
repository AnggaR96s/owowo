Subject: firmware: qcom: scm: suppress download mode error

From: Johan Hovold <johan+linaro@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit d67907154808745b0fae5874edc7b0f78d33991c ]

Stop spamming the logs with errors about missing mechanism for setting
the so called download (or dump) mode for users that have not requested
that feature to be enabled in the first place.

This avoids the follow error being logged on boot as well as on
shutdown when the feature it not available and download mode has not
been enabled on the kernel command line:

	qcom_scm firmware:scm: No available mechanism for setting download mode

Fixes: 79cb2cb8d89b ("firmware: qcom: scm: Disable SDI and write no dump to dump mode")
Fixes: 781d32d1c970 ("firmware: qcom_scm: Clear download bit during reboot")
