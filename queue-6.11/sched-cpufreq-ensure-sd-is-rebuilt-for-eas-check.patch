Subject: sched/cpufreq: Ensure sd is rebuilt for EAS check

From: Christian Loehle <christian.loehle@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit 70d8b6485b0bcd135b6699fc4252d2272818d1fb ]

Ensure sugov_eas_rebuild_sd() is always called when sugov_init()
succeeds. The out goto initialized sugov without forcing the rebuild.

Previously the missing call to sugov_eas_rebuild_sd() could lead to EAS
not being enabled on boot when it should have been, because it requires
all policies to be controlled by schedutil while they might not have
been initialized yet.
