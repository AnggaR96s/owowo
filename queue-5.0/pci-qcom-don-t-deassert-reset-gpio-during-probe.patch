Subject: PCI: qcom: Don't deassert reset GPIO during probe

From: Bjorn Andersson <bjorn.andersson@linaro.org>

commit 02b485e31d98265189b91f3e69c43df2ed50610c upstream.

Acquiring the reset GPIO low means that reset is being deasserted, this
is followed almost immediately with qcom_pcie_host_init() asserting it,
initializing it and then finally deasserting it again, for the link to
come up.

Some PCIe devices requires a minimum time between the initial deassert
and subsequent reset cycles. In a platform that boots with the reset
GPIO asserted this requirement is being violated by this deassert/assert
pulse.

Acquire the reset GPIO high to prevent this situation by matching the
state to the subsequent asserted state.
