Subject: KVM: VMX: Save RSI to an unused output in the vCPU-run asm blob

From: Sean Christopherson <sean.j.christopherson@intel.com>

commit f3689e3f17f064fd4cd5f0cb01ae2395c94f39d9 upstream.

RSI is clobbered by the vCPU-run asm blob, but it's not marked as such,
probably because GCC doesn't let you mark inputs as clobbered.  "Save"
RSI to a dummy output so that GCC recognizes it as being clobbered.
