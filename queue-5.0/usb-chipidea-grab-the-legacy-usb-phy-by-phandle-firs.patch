Subject: usb: chipidea: Grab the (legacy) USB PHY by phandle first

[ Upstream commit 68ef236274793066b9ba3154b16c0acc1c891e5c ]

According to the chipidea driver bindings, the USB PHY is specified via
the "phys" phandle node. However, this only takes effect for USB PHYs
that use the common PHY framework. For legacy USB PHYs, a simple lookup
based on the USB PHY type is done instead.

This does not play out well when more than one USB PHY is registered,
since the first registered PHY matching the type will always be
returned regardless of what the driver was bound to.

Fix this by looking up the PHY based on the "phys" phandle node.
Although generic PHYs are rather matched by their "phys-name" and not
the "phys" phandle directly, there is no helper for similar lookup on
legacy PHYs and it's probably not worth the effort to add it.

When no legacy USB PHY is found by phandle, fallback to grabbing any
registered USB2 PHY. This ensures backward compatibility if some users
were actually relying on this mechanism.
