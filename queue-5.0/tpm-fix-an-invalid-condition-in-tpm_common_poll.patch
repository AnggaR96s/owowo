Subject: tpm: fix an invalid condition in tpm_common_poll
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

[ Upstream commit 7110629263469b4664d00b38ef80a656eddf3637 ]

The poll condition should only check response_length,
because reads should only be issued if there is data to read.
The response_read flag only prevents double writes.
The problem was that the write set the response_read to false,
enqued a tpm job, and returned. Then application called poll
which checked the response_read flag and returned EPOLLIN.
Then the application called read, but got nothing.
After all that the async_work kicked in.
Added also mutex_lock around the poll check to prevent
other possible race conditions.

Fixes: 9488585b21bef0df12 ("tpm: add support for partial reads")
