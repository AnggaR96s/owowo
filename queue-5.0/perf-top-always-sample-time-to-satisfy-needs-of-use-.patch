Subject: perf top: Always sample time to satisfy needs of use of ordered
 queuing

[ Upstream commit 1e6db2ee86e6a4399fc0ae5689e55e0fd1c43caf ]

Bastian reported broken 'perf top -p PID' command, it won't display any
data.

The problem is that for -p option we monitor single thread, so we don't
enable time in samples, because it's not needed.

However since commit 16c66bc167cc we use ordered queues to stash data
plus later commits added logic for dropping samples in case there's big
load and we don't keep up. All this needs timestamp for sample. Enabling
it unconditionally for perf top.
