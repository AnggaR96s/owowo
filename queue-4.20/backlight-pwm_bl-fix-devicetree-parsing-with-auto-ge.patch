Subject: backlight: pwm_bl: Fix devicetree parsing with auto-generated
 brightness tables

[ Upstream commit 61170ee9386888f1e6f7e9cc58e8d9a8c2a3c1dd ]

Commit 88ba95bedb79 ("backlight: pwm_bl: Compute brightness of LED linearly
to human eye") made the parse-dt function return early when using an auto-
generated brightness-table, but didn't take into account that some more
settings were handled below the brightness handling, like power-on-delays
and also setting the pdata enable-gpio to -EINVAL.

This surfaces for example in the case of a backlight without any
enable-gpio which then tries to use gpio-0 in error.

Fix this by simply moving the trailing settings above the brightness
handling.
