Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Extend TZ reserved memory area

From: Marc Gonzalez <marc.w.gonzalez@free.fr>

commit 6e53330909672bd9a8c9f826e989a5945d9d9fdf upstream.

My console locks up as soon as Linux writes to [88800000,88f00000[
AFAIU, that memory area is reserved for trustzone.

Extend TZ reserved memory range, to prevent Linux from stepping on
trustzone's toes.
