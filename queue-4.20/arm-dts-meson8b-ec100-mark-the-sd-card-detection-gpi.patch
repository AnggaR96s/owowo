Subject: ARM: dts: meson8b: ec100: mark the SD card detection GPIO active-low

[ Upstream commit c8bfe65fb1fb7a43d766df1dfa379406112cba61 ]

After commit 89a5e15bcba87d ("gpio/mmc/of: Respect polarity in the device
tree") SD cards are not detected anymore.

The CD GPIO is "active low" on the EC-100. The MMC dt-bindings specify:
"[...] using the "cd-inverted" property means, that the CD line is active
high, i.e. it is high, when a card is inserted".

Fix the description of the SD card by marking it as GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW and
drop the "cd-inverted" property. This makes the definition consistent
with the existing dt-bindings and fixes the check whether an SD card is
inserted.

Fixes: bbedc1f1d90e33 ("ARM: dts: meson8b: Add support for the Endless Mini (EC-100)")
