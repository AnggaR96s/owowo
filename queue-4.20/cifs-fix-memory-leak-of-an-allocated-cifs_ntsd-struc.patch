Subject: cifs: fix memory leak of an allocated cifs_ntsd structure

[ Upstream commit 73aaf920cc72024c4a4460cfa46d56e5014172f3 ]

The call to SMB2_queary_acl can allocate memory to pntsd and also
return a failure via a call to SMB2_query_acl (and then query_info).
This occurs when query_info allocates the structure and then in
query_info the call to smb2_validate_and_copy_iov fails. Currently the
failure just returns without kfree'ing pntsd hence causing a memory
leak.

Currently, *data is allocated if it's not already pointing to a buffer,
so it needs to be kfree'd only if was allocated in query_info, so the
fix adds an allocated flag to track this.  Also set *dlen to zero on
an error just to be safe since *data is kfree'd.

Also set errno to -ENOMEM if the allocation of *data fails.
