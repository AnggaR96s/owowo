Subject: kernel/kcov.c: mark write_comp_data() as notrace

[ Upstream commit 634724431607f6f46c495dfef801a1c8b44a96d9 ]

Since __sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp4 is marked as notrace, the
function called from __sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp4 shouldn't be
traceable either.  ftrace_graph_caller() gets called every time func
write_comp_data() gets called if it isn't marked 'notrace'.  This is the
backtrace from gdb:

 #0  ftrace_graph_caller () at ../arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.S:179
 #1  0xffffff8010201920 in ftrace_caller () at ../arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.S:151
 #2  0xffffff8010439714 in write_comp_data (type=5, arg1=0, arg2=0, ip=18446743524224276596) at ../kernel/kcov.c:116
 #3  0xffffff8010439894 in __sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp4 (arg1=<optimized out>, arg2=<optimized out>) at ../kernel/kcov.c:188
 #4  0xffffff8010201874 in prepare_ftrace_return (self_addr=18446743524226602768, parent=0xffffff801014b918, frame_pointer=18446743524223531344) at ./include/generated/atomic-instrumented.h:27
 #5  0xffffff801020194c in ftrace_graph_caller () at ../arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.S:182

Rework so that write_comp_data() that are called from
__sanitizer_cov_trace_*_cmp*() are marked as 'notrace'.

Commit 903e8ff86753 ("kernel/kcov.c: mark funcs in __sanitizer_cov_trace_pc() as notrace")
missed to mark write_comp_data() as 'notrace'. When that patch was
created gcc-7 was used. In lib/Kconfig.debug
config KCOV_ENABLE_COMPARISONS
	depends on $(cc-option,-fsanitize-coverage=trace-cmp)

That code path isn't hit with gcc-7. However, it were that with gcc-8.
