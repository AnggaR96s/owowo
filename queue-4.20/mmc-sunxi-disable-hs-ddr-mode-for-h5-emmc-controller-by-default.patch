Subject: mmc: sunxi: Disable HS-DDR mode for H5 eMMC controller by default

From: Chen-Yu Tsai <wens@csie.org>

commit d49d92ace4974510dd5845ff91860823cf30dc08 upstream.

Some H5 boards seem to not have proper trace lengths for eMMC to be able
to use the default setting for the delay chains under HS-DDR mode. These
include the Bananapi M2+ H5 and NanoPi NEO Core2. However the Libre
Computer ALL-H3-CC-H5 works just fine.

For the H5 (at least for now), default to not enabling HS-DDR modes in
the driver, and expect the device tree to signal HS-DDR capability on
boards that work.
