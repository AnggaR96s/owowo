Subject: CIFS: Do not hide EINTR after sending network packets

From: Pavel Shilovsky <pshilov@microsoft.com>

commit ee13919c2e8d1f904e035ad4b4239029a8994131 upstream.

Currently we hide EINTR code returned from sock_sendmsg()
and return 0 instead. This makes a caller think that we
successfully completed the network operation which is not
true. Fix this by properly returning EINTR to callers.
