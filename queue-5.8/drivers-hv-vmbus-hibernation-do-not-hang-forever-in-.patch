Subject: Drivers: hv: vmbus: hibernation: do not hang forever in
 vmbus_bus_resume()

From: Dexuan Cui <decui@microsoft.com>

[ Upstream commit 19873eec7e13fda140a0ebc75d6664e57c00bfb1 ]

After we Stop and later Start a VM that uses Accelerated Networking (NIC
SR-IOV), currently the VF vmbus device's Instance GUID can change, so after
vmbus_bus_resume() -> vmbus_request_offers(), vmbus_onoffer() can not find
the original vmbus channel of the VF, and hence we can't complete()
vmbus_connection.ready_for_resume_event in check_ready_for_resume_event(),
and the VM hangs in vmbus_bus_resume() forever.

Fix the issue by adding a timeout, so the resuming can still succeed, and
the saved state is not lost, and according to my test, the user can disable
Accelerated Networking and then will be able to SSH into the VM for
further recovery. Also prevent the VM in question from suspending again.

The host will be fixed so in future the Instance GUID will stay the same
across hibernation.
