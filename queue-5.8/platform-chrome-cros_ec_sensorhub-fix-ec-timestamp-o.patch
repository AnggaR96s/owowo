Subject: platform/chrome: cros_ec_sensorhub: Fix EC timestamp overflow

From: Gwendal Grignou <gwendal@chromium.org>

[ Upstream commit e48bc01ed5adec203676c735365373b31c3c7600 ]

EC is using 32 bit timestamps (us), and before converting it to 64bit
they were not casted, so it would overflow every 4s.
Regular overflow every ~70 minutes was not taken into account either.
