Subject: pinctrl: aspeed: Use the right pinconf mask

From: Andrew Jeffery <andrew@aj.id.au>

[ Upstream commit 1d6db5ae6b090d1a8edfcb36b9bf47c5f4fe27f6 ]

The Aspeed pinconf data structures are split into 'conf' and 'map'
types, where the 'conf' struct defines which register and bitfield to
manipulate, while the 'map' struct defines what value to write to
the register and bitfield.

Both structs have a mask member, and the wrong mask was being used to
tell the regmap which bits to update.

A todo is to look at whether we can remove the mask from the 'map'
struct.
