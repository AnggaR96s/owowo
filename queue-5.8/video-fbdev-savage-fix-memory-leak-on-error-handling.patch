Subject: video: fbdev: savage: fix memory leak on error handling path in probe

From: Evgeny Novikov <novikov@ispras.ru>

[ Upstream commit e8d35898a78e34fc854ed9680bc3f9caedab08cd ]

savagefb_probe() calls savage_init_fb_info() that can successfully
allocate memory for info->pixmap.addr but then fail when
fb_alloc_cmap() fails. savagefb_probe() goes to label failed_init and
does not free allocated memory. It is not valid to go to label
failed_mmio since savage_init_fb_info() can fail during memory
allocation as well. So, the patch free allocated memory on the error
handling path in savage_init_fb_info() itself.

Found by Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org).
