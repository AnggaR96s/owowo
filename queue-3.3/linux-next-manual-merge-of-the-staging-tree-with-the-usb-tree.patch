Hi Greg,

Today's linux-next merge of the staging tree got a conflict in
drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/dt9812.c between commit de15fe3ed9c3
("USB: dt9812.c: remove err() usage") from the usb tree and commit
73e2918990c0 ("staging: Fix typo in multiple files") from the staging
tree.

The former supercedes the latter, so I used that.
