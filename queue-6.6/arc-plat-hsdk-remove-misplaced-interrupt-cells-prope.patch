Subject: ARC: [plat-hsdk]: Remove misplaced interrupt-cells property

From: Alexey Brodkin <Alexey.Brodkin@synopsys.com>

[ Upstream commit 61231eb8113ce47991f35024f9c20810b37996bf ]

"gmac" node stands for just an ordinary Ethernet controller,
which is by no means a provider of interrupts, i.e. it doesn't serve
as an interrupt controller, thus "#interrupt-cells" property doesn't
belong to it and so we remove it.

Fixes:
------------>8------------
  DTC     arch/arc/boot/dts/hsdk.dtb
arch/arc/boot/dts/hsdk.dts:207.23-235.5: Warning (interrupt_provider): /soc/ethernet@8000: '#interrupt-cells' found, but node is not an interrupt provider
arch/arc/boot/dts/hsdk.dtb: Warning (interrupt_map): Failed prerequisite 'interrupt_provider'
------------>8------------
