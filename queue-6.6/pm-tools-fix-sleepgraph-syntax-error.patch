Subject: PM: tools: Fix sleepgraph syntax error

From: David Woodhouse <dwmw@amazon.co.uk>

[ Upstream commit b85e2dab33ce467e8dcf1cb6c0c587132ff17f56 ]

The sleepgraph tool currently fails:

  File "/usr/bin/sleepgraph", line 4155
    or re.match('psci: CPU(?P<cpu>[0-9]*) killed.*', msg)):
                                                         ^
SyntaxError: unmatched ')'

Fixes: 34ea427e01ea ("PM: tools: sleepgraph: Recognize "CPU killed" messages")
