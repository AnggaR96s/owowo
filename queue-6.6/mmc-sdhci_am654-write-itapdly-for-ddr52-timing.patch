Subject: mmc: sdhci_am654: Write ITAPDLY for DDR52 timing

From: Judith Mendez <jm@ti.com>

[ Upstream commit d465234493bb6ad1b9c10a0c9ef9881b8d85081a ]

For DDR52 timing, DLL is enabled but tuning is not carried
out, therefore the ITAPDLY value in PHY CTRL 4 register is
not correct. Fix this by writing ITAPDLY after enabling DLL.

Fixes: a161c45f2979 ("mmc: sdhci_am654: Enable DLL only for some speed modes")
