Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: qrb4210-rb2: don't force usb peripheral mode

From: Caleb Connolly <caleb.connolly@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 27c2ca90e2f34cd3c4849af996e1a96a69e700d3 ]

The rb2 only has a single USB controller, it can be switched between a
type-c port and an internal USB hub via a DIP switch. Until dynamic
role switching is available it's preferable to put the USB controller
in host mode so that the type-A ports and ethernet are available.
