From: "Darrick J. Wong" <djwong@kernel.org>

commit 2a009397eb5ae178670cbd7101e9635cf6412b35 upstream.

[backport: resolve conflicts due to new xattr walk helper]

In my haste to fix what I thought was a performance problem in the attr
scrub code, I neglected to notice that the xfs_attr_get_ilocked also had
the effect of checking that attributes can actually be looked up through
the attr dabtree.  Fix this.

Fixes: 44af6c7e59b12 ("xfs: don't load local xattr values during scrub")
