Subject: block: define bvec_iter as __packed __aligned(4)

From: Ming Lei <ming.lei@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 7838b4656110d950afdd92a081cc0f33e23e0ea8 ]

In commit 19416123ab3e ("block: define 'struct bvec_iter' as packed"),
what we need is to save the 4byte padding, and avoid `bio` to spread on
one extra cache line.

It is enough to define it as '__packed __aligned(4)', as '__packed'
alone means byte aligned, and can cause compiler to generate horrible
code on architectures that don't support unaligned access in case that
bvec_iter is embedded in other structures.
