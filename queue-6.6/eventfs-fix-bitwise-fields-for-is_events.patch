commit fd56cd5f6d76e93356d9520cf9dabffe1e3d1aa0 upstream.

A flag was needed to denote which eventfs_inode was the "events"
directory, so a bit was taken from the "nr_entries" field, as there's not
that many entries, and 2^30 is plenty. But the bit number for nr_entries
was not updated to reflect the bit taken from it, which would add an
unnecessary integer to the structure.
