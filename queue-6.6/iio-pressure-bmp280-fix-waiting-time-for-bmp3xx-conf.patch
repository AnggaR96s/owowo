Subject: iio: pressure: bmp280: Fix waiting time for BMP3xx configuration

From: Vasileios Amoiridis <vassilisamir@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 262a6634bcc4f0c1c53d13aa89882909f281a6aa ]

According to the datasheet, both pressure and temperature can go up to
oversampling x32. With this option, the maximum measurement time is not
80ms (this is for press x32 and temp x2), but it is 130ms nominal
(calculated from table 3.9.2) and since most of the maximum values
are around +15%, it is configured to 150ms.
