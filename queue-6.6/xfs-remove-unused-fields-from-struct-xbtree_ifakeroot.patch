Subject: xfs: remove unused fields from struct xbtree_ifakeroot
To: stable@vger.kernel.org
Cc: linux-xfs@vger.kernel.org
Message-ID: <20240327001233.51675-13-catherine.hoang@oracle.com>

From: "Darrick J. Wong" <djwong@kernel.org>

commit 4c8ecd1cfdd01fb727121035014d9f654a30bdf2 upstream.

Remove these unused fields since nobody uses them.  They should have
been removed years ago in a different cleanup series from Christoph
Hellwig.

Fixes: daf83964a3681 ("xfs: move the per-fork nextents fields into struct xfs_ifork")
Fixes: f7e67b20ecbbc ("xfs: move the fork format fields into struct xfs_ifork")
