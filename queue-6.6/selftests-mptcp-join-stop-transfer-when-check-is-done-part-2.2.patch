From: "Matthieu Baerts (NGI0)" <matttbe@kernel.org>

Use mptcp_lib_kill_wait in "userspace pm create id 0 subflow" subtest.

This new test has recently been queued to v6.6 [1] with the backport of
commit b2e2248f365a ("selftests: mptcp: userspace pm create id 0
subflow").

The modification here was part of commit 04b57c9e096a ("selftests:
mptcp: join: stop transfer when check is done (part 2)") that has been
backported to v6.6 a few months ago -- see commit 358f02b84fbb
("selftests: mptcp: join: stop transfer when check is done (part 2)") --
but it was not modifying this subtest as it was not present in v6.6.
