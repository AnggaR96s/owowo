Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Add sdmmc related properties on
 rk3308-rock-pi-s

From: Jonas Karlman <jonas@kwiboo.se>

[ Upstream commit fc0daeccc384233eadfa9d5ddbd00159653c6bdc ]

Add cap-mmc-highspeed to allow use of high speed MMC mode using an eMMC
to uSD board. Use disable-wp to signal that no physical write-protect
line is present. Also add vcc_io used for card and IO line power as
vmmc-supply.
