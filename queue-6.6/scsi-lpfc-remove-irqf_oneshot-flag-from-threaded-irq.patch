Subject: scsi: lpfc: Remove IRQF_ONESHOT flag from threaded IRQ handling

From: Justin Tee <justin.tee@broadcom.com>

[ Upstream commit 4623713e7ade46bfc63a3eade836f566ccbcd771 ]

IRQF_ONESHOT is found to mask HBA generated interrupts when thread_fn is
running.  As a result, some EQEs/CQEs miss timely processing resulting in
SCSI layer attempts to abort commands due to io_timeout.  Abort CQEs are
also not processed leading to the observations of hangs and spam of "0748
abort handler timed out waiting for aborting I/O" log messages.

Remove the IRQF_ONESHOT flag.  The cmpxchg and xchg atomic operations on
lpfc_queue->queue_claimed already protect potential parallel access to an
EQ/CQ should the thread_fn get interrupted by the primary irq handler.
