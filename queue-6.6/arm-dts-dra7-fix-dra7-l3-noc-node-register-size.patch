Subject: ARM: dts: dra7: Fix DRA7 L3 NoC node register size

From: Andrew Davis <afd@ti.com>

[ Upstream commit 1e5caee2ba8f1426e8098afb4ca38dc40a0ca71b ]

This node can access any part of the L3 configuration registers space,
including CLK1 and CLK2 which are 0x800000 offset. Restore this area
size to include these areas.

Fixes: 7f2659ce657e ("ARM: dts: Move dra7 l3 noc to a separate node")
