Subject: wifi: brcm80211: BRCM_TRACING should depend on TRACING

From: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert@linux-m68k.org>

[ Upstream commit b73b2069528f90ec49d5fa1010a759baa2c2be05 ]

When tracing is disabled, there is no point in asking the user about
enabling Broadcom wireless device tracing.

Fixes: f5c4f10852d42012 ("brcm80211: Allow trace support to be enabled separately from debug")
