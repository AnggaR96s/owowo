Subject: gcc-9: silence 'address-of-packed-member' warning

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

commit 6f303d60534c46aa1a239f29c321f95c83dda748 upstream.

We already did this for clang, but now gcc has that warning too.  Yes,
yes, the address may be unaligned.  And that's kind of the point.
