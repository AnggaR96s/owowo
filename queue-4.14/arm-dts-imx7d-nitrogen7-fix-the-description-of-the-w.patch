Subject: ARM: dts: imx7d-nitrogen7: Fix the description of the Wifi clock

[ Upstream commit f15096f12a4e9340168df5fdd9201aa8ed60d59e ]

According to bindings/regulator/fixed-regulator.txt the 'clocks' and
'clock-names' properties are not valid ones.

In order to turn on the Wifi clock the correct location for describing
the CLKO2 clock is via a mmc-pwrseq handle, so do it accordingly.
