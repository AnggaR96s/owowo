Subject: Btrfs: fix missing error return if writeback for extent buffer never
 started

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

[ Upstream commit 0607eb1d452d45c5ac4c745a9e9e0d95152ea9d0 ]

If lock_extent_buffer_for_io() fails, it returns a negative value, but its
caller btree_write_cache_pages() ignores such error. This means that a
call to flush_write_bio(), from lock_extent_buffer_for_io(), might have
failed. We should make btree_write_cache_pages() notice such error values
and stop immediatelly, making sure filemap_fdatawrite_range() returns an
error to the transaction commit path. A failure from flush_write_bio()
should also result in the endio callback end_bio_extent_buffer_writepage()
being invoked, which sets the BTRFS_FS_*_ERR bits appropriately, so that
there's no risk a transaction or log commit doesn't catch a writeback
failure.
