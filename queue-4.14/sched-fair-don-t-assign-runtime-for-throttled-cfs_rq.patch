Subject: sched/fair: Don't assign runtime for throttled cfs_rq

From: Liangyan <liangyan.peng@linux.alibaba.com>

commit 5e2d2cc2588bd3307ce3937acbc2ed03c830a861 upstream.

do_sched_cfs_period_timer() will refill cfs_b runtime and call
distribute_cfs_runtime to unthrottle cfs_rq, sometimes cfs_b->runtime
will allocate all quota to one cfs_rq incorrectly, then other cfs_rqs
attached to this cfs_b can't get runtime and will be throttled.

We find that one throttled cfs_rq has non-negative
cfs_rq->runtime_remaining and cause an unexpetced cast from s64 to u64
in snippet:

  distribute_cfs_runtime() {
    runtime = -cfs_rq->runtime_remaining + 1;
  }

The runtime here will change to a large number and consume all
cfs_b->runtime in this cfs_b period.

According to Ben Segall, the throttled cfs_rq can have
account_cfs_rq_runtime called on it because it is throttled before
idle_balance, and the idle_balance calls update_rq_clock to add time
that is accounted to the task.

This commit prevents cfs_rq to be assgined new runtime if it has been
throttled until that distribute_cfs_runtime is called.
