Subject: extcon: sm5502: Drop invalid register write in sm5502_reg_data

From: Stephan Gerhold <stephan@gerhold.net>

[ Upstream commit d25b224f8e5507879b36a769a6d1324cf163466c ]

When sm5502_init_dev_type() iterates over sm5502_reg_data to
initialize the registers it is limited by ARRAY_SIZE(sm5502_reg_data).
There is no need to add another empty element to sm5502_reg_data.

Having the additional empty element in sm5502_reg_data will just
result in writing 0xff to register 0x00, which does not really
make sense.
