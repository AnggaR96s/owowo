Subject: ARM: dts: omap5: enable OTG role for DWC3 controller

From: H. Nikolaus Schaller <hns@goldelico.com>

[ Upstream commit 656c1a65ab555ee5c7cd0d6aee8ab82ca3c1795f ]

Since SMPS10 and OTG cable detection extcon are described here, and
work to enable OTG power when an OTG cable is plugged in, we can
define OTG mode in the controller (which is disabled by default in
omap5.dtsi).

Tested on OMAP5EVM and Pyra.
