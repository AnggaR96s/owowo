Subject: fs/lock: skip lock owner pid translation in case we are in init_pid_ns

From: Konstantin Khorenko <khorenko@virtuozzo.com>

[ Upstream commit 826d7bc9f013d01e92997883d2fd0c25f4af1f1c ]

If the flock owner process is dead and its pid has been already freed,
pid translation won't work, but we still want to show flock owner pid
number when expecting /proc/$PID/fdinfo/$FD in init pidns.

Reproducer:
process A	process A1	process A2
fork()--------->
exit()		open()
		flock()
		fork()--------->
		exit()		sleep()

Before the patch:
================
(root@vz7)/: cat /proc/${PID_A2}/fdinfo/3
pos:    4
flags:  02100002
mnt_id: 257
lock:   (root@vz7)/:

After the patch:
===============
(root@vz7)/:cat /proc/${PID_A2}/fdinfo/3
pos:    4
flags:  02100002
mnt_id: 295
lock:   1: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE ${PID_A1} b6:f8a61:529946 0 EOF

Fixes: 9d5b86ac13c5 ("fs/locks: Remove fl_nspid and use fs-specific l_pid for remote locks")
