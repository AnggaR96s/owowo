Subject: ARM: dts: imx6: phyFLEX: Fix UART hardware flow control

From: Primoz Fiser <primoz.fiser@norik.com>

[ Upstream commit 14cdc1f243d79e0b46be150502b7dba9c5a6bdfd ]

Serial interface uart3 on phyFLEX board is capable of 5-wire connection
including signals RTS and CTS for hardware flow control.

Fix signals UART3_CTS_B and UART3_RTS_B padmux assignments and add
missing property "uart-has-rtscts" to allow serial interface to be
configured and used with the hardware flow control.
