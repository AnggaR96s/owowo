Subject: ASoC: codec: hdac_hdmi add device_link to card device

From: Libin Yang <libin.yang@intel.com>

commit 01c8327667c249818d3712c3e25c7ad2aca7f389 upstream.

In resume from S3, HDAC HDMI codec driver dapm event callback may be
operated before HDMI codec driver turns on the display audio power
domain because of the contest between display driver and hdmi codec driver.

This patch adds the device_link between soc card device (consumer) and
hdmi codec device (supplier) to make sure the sequence is always correct.
