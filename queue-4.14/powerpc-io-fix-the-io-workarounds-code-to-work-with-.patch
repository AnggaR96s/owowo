Subject: powerpc/io: Fix the IO workarounds code to work with Radix

[ Upstream commit 43c6494fa1499912c8177e71450c0279041152a6 ]

Back in 2006 Ben added some workarounds for a misbehaviour in the
Spider IO bridge used on early Cell machines, see commit
014da7ff47b5 ("[POWERPC] Cell "Spider" MMIO workarounds"). Later these
were made to be generic, ie. not tied specifically to Spider.

The code stashes a token in the high bits (59-48) of virtual addresses
used for IO (eg. returned from ioremap()). This works fine when using
the Hash MMU, but when we're using the Radix MMU the bits used for the
token overlap with some of the bits of the virtual address.

This is because the maximum virtual address is larger with Radix, up
to c00fffffffffffff, and in fact we use that high part of the address
range for ioremap(), see RADIX_KERN_IO_START.

As it happens the bits that are used overlap with the bits that
differentiate an IO address vs a linear map address. If the resulting
address lies outside the linear mapping we will crash (see below), if
not we just corrupt memory.

This hasn't been a problem because CONFIG_PPC_IO_WORKAROUNDS which
enables this code is usually not enabled. It is only enabled when it's
selected by PPC_CELL_NATIVE which is only selected by
PPC_IBM_CELL_BLADE and that in turn depends on BIG_ENDIAN. So in order
to hit the bug you need to build a big endian kernel, with IBM Cell
Blade support enabled, as well as Radix MMU support, and then boot
that on Power9 using Radix MMU.

Still we can fix the bug, so let's do that. We simply use fewer bits
for the token, taking the union of the restrictions on the address
from both Hash and Radix, we end up with 8 bits we can use for the
token. The only user of the token is iowa_mem_find_bus() which only
supports 8 token values, so 8 bits is plenty for that.
