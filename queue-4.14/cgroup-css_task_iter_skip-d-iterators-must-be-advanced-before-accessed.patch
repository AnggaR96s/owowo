Subject: cgroup: css_task_iter_skip()'d iterators must be advanced before accessed

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

commit cee0c33c546a93957a52ae9ab6bebadbee765ec5 upstream.

b636fd38dc40 ("cgroup: Implement css_task_iter_skip()") introduced
css_task_iter_skip() which is used to fix task iterations skipping
dying threadgroup leaders with live threads.  Skipping is implemented
as a subportion of full advancing but css_task_iter_next() forgot to
fully advance a skipped iterator before determining the next task to
visit causing it to return invalid task pointers.

Fix it by making css_task_iter_next() fully advance the iterator if it
has been skipped since the previous iteration.
