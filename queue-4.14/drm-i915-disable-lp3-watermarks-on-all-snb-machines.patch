Subject: drm/i915: Disable LP3 watermarks on all SNB machines
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

[ Upstream commit 03981c6ebec4fc7056b9b45f847393aeac90d060 ]

I have a Thinkpad X220 Tablet in my hands that is losing vblank
interrupts whenever LP3 watermarks are used.

If I nudge the latency value written to the WM3 register just
by one in either direction the problem disappears. That to me
suggests that the punit will not enter the corrsponding
powersave mode (MPLL shutdown IIRC) unless the latency value
in the register matches exactly what we read from SSKPD. Ie.
it's not really a latency value but rather just a cookie
by which the punit can identify the desired power saving state.
On HSW/BDW this was changed such that we actually just write
the WM level number into those bits, which makes much more
sense given the observed behaviour.

We could try to handle this by disallowing LP3 watermarks
only when vblank interrupts are enabled but we'd first have
to prove that only vblank interrupts are affected, which
seems unlikely. Also we can't grab the wm mutex from the
vblank enable/disable hooks because those are called with
various spinlocks held. Thus we'd have to redesigne the
watermark locking. So to play it safe and keep the code
simple we simply disable LP3 watermarks on all SNB machines.

To do that we simply zero out the latency values for
watermark level 3, and we adjust the watermark computation
to check for that. The behaviour now matches that of the
g4x/vlv/skl wm code in the presence of a zeroed latency
value.

v2: s/USHRT_MAX/U32_MAX/ for consistency with the types (Chris)
