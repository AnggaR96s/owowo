Subject: cpufreq: Add NULL checks to show() and store() methods of cpufreq

From: Kai Shen <shenkai8@huawei.com>

commit e6e8df07268c1f75dd9215536e2ce4587b70f977 upstream.

Add NULL checks to show() and store() in cpufreq.c to avoid attempts
to invoke a NULL callback.

Though some interfaces of cpufreq are set as read-only, users can
still get write permission using chmod which can lead to a kernel
crash, as follows:

chmod +w /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
echo 1 >  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq

This bug was found in linux 4.19.
