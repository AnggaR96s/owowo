Subject: mm/khugepaged: collapse_shmem() stop if punched or truncated

commit 701270fa193aadf00bdcf607738f64997275d4c7 upstream.

Huge tmpfs testing showed that although collapse_shmem() recognizes a
concurrently truncated or hole-punched page correctly, its handling of
holes was liable to refill an emptied extent.  Add check to stop that.
