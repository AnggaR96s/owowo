[ Upstream commit 2c0fd6b3d0778ceab40205315ccef74568490f17 ]

Switch away from deprecated properties.

This fixes:
arch/arm/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm947189acdbmr.dtb: spi: gpio-sck: False schema does not allow [[3, 21, 0]]
        From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-gpio.yaml
arch/arm/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm947189acdbmr.dtb: spi: gpio-miso: False schema does not allow [[3, 22, 0]]
        From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-gpio.yaml
arch/arm/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm947189acdbmr.dtb: spi: gpio-mosi: False schema does not allow [[3, 23, 0]]
        From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-gpio.yaml
arch/arm/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm947189acdbmr.dtb: spi: 'sck-gpios' is a required property
        From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-gpio.yaml
arch/arm/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm947189acdbmr.dtb: spi: Unevaluated properties are not allowed ('gpio-miso', 'gpio-mosi', 'gpio-sck' were unexpected)
        From schema: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-gpio.yaml
