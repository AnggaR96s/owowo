Subject: ext4: actually request zeroing of inode table after grow

From: Kirill Tkhai <ktkhai@virtuozzo.com>

commit 310a997fd74de778b9a4848a64be9cda9f18764a upstream.

It is never possible, that number of block groups decreases,
since only online grow is supported.

But after a growing occured, we have to zero inode tables
for just created new block groups.
