Subject: s390/dasd: use correct number of retries for ERP requests

From: Stefan Haberland <sth@linux.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit acea28a6b74f458defda7417d2217b051ba7d444 ]

If a DASD request fails an error recovery procedure (ERP) request might
be built as a copy of the original request to do error recovery.

The ERP request gets a number of retries assigned.
This number is always 256 no matter what other value might have been set
for the original request. This is not what is expected when a user
specifies a certain amount of retries for the device via sysfs.

Correctly use the number of retries of the original request for ERP
requests.
