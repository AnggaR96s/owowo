Subject: drivers/of/of_mdio.c:fix of_mdiobus_register()

From: Dajun Jin <adajunjin@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 209c65b61d94344522c41a83cd6ce51aac5fd0a4 ]

When registers a phy_device successful, should terminate the loop
or the phy_device would be registered in other addr. If there are
multiple PHYs without reg properties, it will go wrong.
