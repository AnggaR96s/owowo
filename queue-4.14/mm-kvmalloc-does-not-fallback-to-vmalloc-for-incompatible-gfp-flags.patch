Subject: mm: kvmalloc does not fallback to vmalloc for incompatible gfp flags

From: Michal Hocko <mhocko@suse.com>

commit ce91f6ee5b3bbbad8caff61b1c46d845c8db19bf upstream.

kvmalloc warned about incompatible gfp_mask to catch abusers (mostly
GFP_NOFS) with an intention that this will motivate authors of the code
to fix those.  Linus argues that this just motivates people to do even
more hacks like

	if (gfp == GFP_KERNEL)
		kvmalloc
	else
		kmalloc

I haven't seen this happening much (Linus pointed to bucket_lock special
cases an atomic allocation but my git foo hasn't found much more) but it
is true that we can grow those in future.  Therefore Linus suggested to
simply not fallback to vmalloc for incompatible gfp flags and rather
stick with the kmalloc path.
