commit da72a379b2ec0bad3eb265787f7008bead0b040c upstream.

VMD subdevices are created with a PCI domain ID of 0x10000 or
higher.

These subdevices are also handled like all other PCI devices by
dmar_pci_bus_notifier().

However, when dmar_alloc_pci_notify_info() take records of such devices,
it will truncate the domain ID to a u16 value (in info->seg).
The device at (e.g.) 10000:00:02.0 is then treated by the DMAR code as if
it is 0000:00:02.0.

In the unlucky event that a real device also exists at 0000:00:02.0 and
also has a device-specific entry in the DMAR table,
dmar_insert_dev_scope() will crash on:
 Â  BUG_ON(i >= devices_cnt);

That's basically a sanity check that only one PCI device matches a
single DMAR entry; in this case we seem to have two matching devices.

Fix this by ignoring devices that have a domain number higher than
what can be looked up in the DMAR table.

This problem was carefully diagnosed by Jian-Hong Pan.
