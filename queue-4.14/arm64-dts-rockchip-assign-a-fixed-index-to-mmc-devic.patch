Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Assign a fixed index to mmc devices on rk3399
 boards.

From: Markus Reichl <m.reichl@fivetechno.de>

[ Upstream commit 0011c6d182774fc781fb9e115ebe8baa356029ae ]

Recently introduced async probe on mmc devices can shuffle block IDs.
Pin them to fixed values to ease booting in environments where UUIDs
are not practical. Use newly introduced aliases for mmcblk devices from [1].
