Subject: arm64: dts: meson-gxl-khadas-vim: fix GPIO lines names

From: Neil Armstrong <narmstrong@baylibre.com>

[ Upstream commit 5b78012636f537344bd551934387f5772c38ba80 ]

The gpio line names were set in the pinctrl node instead of the gpio node,
at the time it was merged, it worked, but was obviously wrong.
This patch moves the properties to the gpio nodes.

Fixes: 60795933b709 ("ARM64: dts: meson-gxl-khadas-vim: Add GPIO lines names")
