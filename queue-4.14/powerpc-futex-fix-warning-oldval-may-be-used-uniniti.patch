Subject: powerpc/futex: Fix warning: 'oldval' may be used uninitialized in
 this function

From: Christophe Leroy <christophe.leroy@c-s.fr>

[ Upstream commit 38a0d0cdb46d3f91534e5b9839ec2d67be14c59d ]

We see warnings such as:
  kernel/futex.c: In function 'do_futex':
  kernel/futex.c:1676:17: warning: 'oldval' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
     return oldval == cmparg;
                   ^
  kernel/futex.c:1651:6: note: 'oldval' was declared here
    int oldval, ret;
        ^

This is because arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser() only sets *oval if ret
is 0 and GCC doesn't see that it will only use it when ret is 0.

Anyway, the non-zero ret path is an error path that won't suffer from
setting *oval, and as *oval is a local var in futex_atomic_op_inuser()
it will have no impact.
