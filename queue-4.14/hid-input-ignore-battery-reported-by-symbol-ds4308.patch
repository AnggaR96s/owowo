Subject: HID: input: Ignore battery reported by Symbol DS4308

[ Upstream commit 0fd791841a6d67af1155a9c3de54dea51220721e ]

The Motorola/Zebra Symbol DS4308-HD is a handheld USB barcode scanner
which does not have a battery, but reports one anyway that always has
capacity 2.

Let's apply the IGNORE quirk to prevent it from being treated like a
power supply so that userspaces don't get confused that this
accessory is almost out of power and warn the user that they need to charge
their wired barcode scanner.

Reported here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=804720
