Subject: ARM: dts: exynos: correct PMIC interrupt trigger level on Monk

From: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzk@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 8528cda2b7c667e9cd173aef1a677c71b7d5a096 ]

The Samsung PMIC datasheets describe the interrupt line as active low
with a requirement of acknowledge from the CPU.  Without specifying the
interrupt type in Devicetree, kernel might apply some fixed
configuration, not necessarily working for this hardware.

Fixes: e0cefb3f79d3 ("ARM: dts: add board dts file for Exynos3250-based Monk board")
