Subject: ARM: dts: r8a7791: Correct critical CPU temperature

From: Chris Paterson <chris.paterson2@renesas.com>

commit e4fdf59bcce3b490bbc7197145bcb9f9d5a18cd3 upstream.

The R-Car M2W hardware manual states that Tc = –40°C to +105°C. The
thermal sensor has an accuracy of ±5°C and there can be a temperature
difference of 1 or 2 degrees between Tjmax and the thermal sensor due
to the location of the latter.

This means that 95°C is a safer value to use.
