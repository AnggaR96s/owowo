Subject: s390/kasan: fix strncpy_from_user kasan checks

[ Upstream commit 01eb42afb45719cb41bb32c278e068073738899d ]

arch/s390/lib/uaccess.c is built without kasan instrumentation. Kasan
checks are performed explicitly in copy_from_user/copy_to_user
functions. But since those functions could be inlined, calls from
files like uaccess.c with instrumentation disabled won't generate
kasan reports. This is currently the case with strncpy_from_user
function which was revealed by newly added kasan test. Avoid inlining of
copy_from_user/copy_to_user when the kernel is built with kasan support
to make sure kasan checks are fully functional.
