Subject: spi: Fix zero length xfer bug

[ Upstream commit 5442dcaa0d90fc376bdfc179a018931a8f43dea4 ]

This fixes a bug for messages containing both zero length and
unidirectional xfers.

The function spi_map_msg will allocate dummy tx and/or rx buffers
for use with unidirectional transfers when the hardware can only do
a bidirectional transfer.  That dummy buffer will be used in place
of a NULL buffer even when the xfer length is 0.

Then in the function __spi_map_msg, if he hardware can dma,
the zero length xfer will have spi_map_buf called on the dummy
buffer.

Eventually, __sg_alloc_table is called and returns -EINVAL
because nents == 0.

This fix prevents the error by not using the dummy buffer when
the xfer length is zero.
