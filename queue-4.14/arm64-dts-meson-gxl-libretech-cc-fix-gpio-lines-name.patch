Subject: arm64: dts: meson-gxl-libretech-cc: fix GPIO lines names

From: Neil Armstrong <narmstrong@baylibre.com>

[ Upstream commit 11fa9774612decea87144d7f950a9c53a4fe3050 ]

The gpio line names were set in the pinctrl node instead of the gpio node,
at the time it was merged, it worked, but was obviously wrong.
This patch moves the properties to the gpio nodes.

Fixes: 47884c5c746e ("ARM64: dts: meson-gxl-libretech-cc: Add GPIO lines names")
