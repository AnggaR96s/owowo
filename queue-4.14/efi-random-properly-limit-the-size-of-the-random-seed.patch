Commit be36f9e7517e ("efi: READ_ONCE rng seed size before munmap")
added a READ_ONCE() and also changed the call to
add_bootloader_randomness() to use the local size variable.  Neither
of these changes was actually needed and this was not backported to
the 4.14 stable branch.

Commit 161a438d730d ("efi: random: reduce seed size to 32 bytes")
reverted the addition of READ_ONCE() and added a limit to the value of
size.  This depends on the earlier commit, because size can now differ
from seed->size, but it was wrongly backported to the 4.14 stable
branch by itself.

Apply the missing change to the add_bootloader_randomness() parameter
(except that here we are still using add_device_randomness()).
