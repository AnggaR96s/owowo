Subject: ext4: missing !bh check in ext4_xattr_inode_write()

From: Vasily Averin <vvs@virtuozzo.com>

commit eb6984fa4ce2837dcb1f66720a600f31b0bb3739 upstream.

According to Ted Ts'o ext4_getblk() called in ext4_xattr_inode_write()
should not return bh = NULL

The only time that bh could be NULL, then, would be in the case of
something really going wrong; a programming error elsewhere (perhaps a
wild pointer dereference) or I/O error causing on-disk file system
corruption (although that would be highly unlikely given that we had
*just* allocated the blocks and so the metadata blocks in question
probably would still be in the cache).

Fixes: e50e5129f384 ("ext4: xattr-in-inode support")
