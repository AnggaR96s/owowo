Subject: workqueue: Kick a worker based on the actual activation of delayed
 works

From: Yunfeng Ye <yeyunfeng@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit 01341fbd0d8d4e717fc1231cdffe00343088ce0b ]

In realtime scenario, We do not want to have interference on the
isolated cpu cores. but when invoking alloc_workqueue() for percpu wq
on the housekeeping cpu, it kick a kworker on the isolated cpu.

  alloc_workqueue
    pwq_adjust_max_active
      wake_up_worker

The comment in pwq_adjust_max_active() said:
  "Need to kick a worker after thawed or an unbound wq's
   max_active is bumped"

So it is unnecessary to kick a kworker for percpu's wq when invoking
alloc_workqueue(). this patch only kick a worker based on the actual
activation of delayed works.
