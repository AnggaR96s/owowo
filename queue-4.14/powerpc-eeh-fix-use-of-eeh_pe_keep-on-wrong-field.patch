Subject: powerpc/eeh: Fix use of EEH_PE_KEEP on wrong field

From: Sam Bobroff <sbobroff@linux.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit 473af09b56dc4be68e4af33220ceca6be67aa60d ]

eeh_add_to_parent_pe() sometimes removes the EEH_PE_KEEP flag, but it
incorrectly removes it from pe->type, instead of pe->state.

However, rather than clearing it from the correct field, remove it.
Inspection of the code shows that it can't ever have had any effect
(even if it had been cleared from the correct field), because the
field is never tested after it is cleared by the statement in
question.

The clear statement was added by commit 807a827d4e74 ("powerpc/eeh:
Keep PE during hotplug"), but it didn't explain why it was necessary.
