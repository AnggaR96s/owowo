Subject: qed: Fix the VF msix vectors flow

From: Shai Malin <smalin@marvell.com>

[ Upstream commit b0cd08537db8d2fbb227cdb2e5835209db295a24 ]

For VFs we should return with an error in case we didn't get the exact
number of msix vectors as we requested.
Not doing that will lead to a crash when starting queues for this VF.
