Subject: sctp: add size validation when walking chunks

From: Marcelo Ricardo Leitner <marcelo.leitner@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 50619dbf8db77e98d821d615af4f634d08e22698 ]

The first chunk in a packet is ensured to be present at the beginning of
sctp_rcv(), as a packet needs to have at least 1 chunk. But the second
one, may not be completely available and ch->length can be over
uninitialized memory.

Fix here is by only trying to walk on the next chunk if there is enough to
hold at least the header, and then proceed with the ch->length validation
that is already there.
