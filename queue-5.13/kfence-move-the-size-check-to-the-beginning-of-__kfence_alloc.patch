Subject: kfence: move the size check to the beginning of __kfence_alloc()

From: Alexander Potapenko <glider@google.com>

commit 235a85cb32bb123854ad31de46fdbf04c1d57cda upstream.

Check the allocation size before toggling kfence_allocation_gate.

This way allocations that can't be served by KFENCE will not result in
waiting for another CONFIG_KFENCE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL without allocating
anything.
