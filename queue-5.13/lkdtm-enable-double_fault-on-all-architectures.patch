Subject: lkdtm: Enable DOUBLE_FAULT on all architectures

From: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>

commit f123c42bbeff26bfe8bdb08a01307e92d51eec39 upstream.

Where feasible, I prefer to have all tests visible on all architectures,
but to have them wired to XFAIL. DOUBLE_FAIL was set up to XFAIL, but
wasn't actually being added to the test list.
