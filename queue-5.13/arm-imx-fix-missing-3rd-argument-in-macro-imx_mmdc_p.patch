Subject: ARM: imx: fix missing 3rd argument in macro imx_mmdc_perf_init

From: Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com>

[ Upstream commit 20fb73911fec01f06592de1cdbca00b66602ebd7 ]

The function imx_mmdc_perf_init recently had a 3rd argument added to
it but the equivalent macro was not updated and is still the older
2 argument version. Fix this by adding in the missing 3rd argumement
mmdc_ipg_clk.

Fixes: f07ec8536580 ("ARM: imx: add missing clk_disable_unprepare()")
