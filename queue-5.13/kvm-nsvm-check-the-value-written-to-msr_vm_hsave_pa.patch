Subject: KVM: nSVM: Check the value written to MSR_VM_HSAVE_PA

From: Vitaly Kuznetsov <vkuznets@redhat.com>

commit fce7e152ffc8f89d02a80617b16c7aa1527847c8 upstream.

APM states that #GP is raised upon write to MSR_VM_HSAVE_PA when
the supplied address is not page-aligned or is outside of "maximum
supported physical address for this implementation".
page_address_valid() check seems suitable. Also, forcefully page-align
the address when it's written from VMM.
