Subject: kfence: skip all GFP_ZONEMASK allocations

From: Alexander Potapenko <glider@google.com>

commit 236e9f1538523d3d380dda1cc99571d587058f37 upstream.

Allocation requests outside ZONE_NORMAL (MOVABLE, HIGHMEM or DMA) cannot
be fulfilled by KFENCE, because KFENCE memory pool is located in a zone
different from the requested one.

Because callers of kmem_cache_alloc() may actually rely on the
allocation to reside in the requested zone (e.g.  memory allocations
done with __GFP_DMA must be DMAable), skip all allocations done with
GFP_ZONEMASK and/or respective SLAB flags (SLAB_CACHE_DMA and
SLAB_CACHE_DMA32).
