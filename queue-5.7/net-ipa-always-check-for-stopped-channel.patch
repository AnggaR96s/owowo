Subject: net: ipa: always check for stopped channel

From: Alex Elder <elder@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 5468cbcddf47f674829c6ada190283108a63d7b5 ]

In gsi_channel_stop(), there's a check to see if the channel might
have entered STOPPED state since a previous call, which might have
timed out before stopping completed.

That check actually belongs in gsi_channel_stop_command(), which is
called repeatedly by gsi_channel_stop() for RX channels.

Fixes: 650d1603825d ("soc: qcom: ipa: the generic software interface")
