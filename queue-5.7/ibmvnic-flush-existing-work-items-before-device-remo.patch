Subject: ibmvnic: Flush existing work items before device removal

From: Thomas Falcon <tlfalcon@linux.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit 6954a9e4192b86d778fb52b525fd7b62d51b1147 ]

Ensure that all scheduled work items have completed before continuing
with device removal and after further event scheduling has been
halted. This patch fixes a bug where a scheduled driver reset event
is processed following device removal.
