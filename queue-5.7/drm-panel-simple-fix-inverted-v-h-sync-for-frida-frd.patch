Subject: drm/panel-simple: Fix inverted V/H SYNC for Frida FRD350H54004 panel

From: Paul Cercueil <paul@crapouillou.net>

[ Upstream commit bad20a2dbfdfaf01560026909506b6ed69d65ba2 ]

The FRD350H54004 panel was marked as having active-high VSYNC and HSYNC
signals, which sorts-of worked, but resulted in the picture fading out
under certain circumstances.

Fix this issue by marking VSYNC and HSYNC signals active-low.

v2: Rebase on drm-misc-next

Fixes: 7b6bd8433609 ("drm/panel: simple: Add support for the Frida FRD350H54004 panel")
