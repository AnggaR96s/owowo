Subject: scsi: lpfc: Avoid another null dereference in lpfc_sli4_hba_unset()

From: SeongJae Park <sjpark@amazon.de>

[ Upstream commit 46da547e21d6cefceec3fb3dba5ebbca056627fc ]

Commit cdb42becdd40 ("scsi: lpfc: Replace io_channels for nvme and fcp with
general hdw_queues per cpu") has introduced static checker warnings for
potential null dereferences in 'lpfc_sli4_hba_unset()' and commit 1ffdd2c0440d
("scsi: lpfc: resolve static checker warning in lpfc_sli4_hba_unset") has
tried to fix it.  However, yet another potential null dereference is
remaining.  This commit fixes it.

This bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis
Security Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.
