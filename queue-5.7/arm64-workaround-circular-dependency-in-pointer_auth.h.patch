Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Workaround circular dependency in pointer_auth.h

From: Marc Zyngier <maz@kernel.org>

With the backport of f227e3ec3b5c ("random32: update the net random
state on interrupt and activity") and its associated fixes, the
arm64 build explodes early:

In file included from ../include/linux/smp.h:67,
                  from ../include/linux/percpu.h:7,
                  from ../include/linux/prandom.h:12,
                  from ../include/linux/random.h:118,
                  from ../arch/arm64/include/asm/pointer_auth.h:6,

                  from ../include/linux/irqdomain.h:35,
                  from ../include/linux/acpi.h:13,

                  from ../include/acpi/ghes.h:5,
                  from ../include/linux/arm_sdei.h:8,
                  from ../arch/arm64/kernel/asm-offsets.c:10:
../arch/arm64/include/asm/smp.h:100:29: error: field ‘ptrauth_key’ has
incomplete type

This is due to struct ptrauth_keys_kernel not being defined before
we transitively include asm/smp.h from linux/random.h.

Paper over it by moving the inclusion of linux/random.h *after* the
type has been defined.
