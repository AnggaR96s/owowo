Subject: PCI/PM: Adjust pcie_wait_for_link_delay() for caller delay

From: Bjorn Helgaas <bhelgaas@google.com>

[ Upstream commit f044baaff1eb7ae5aa7a36f1b7ad5bd8eeb672c4 ]

The caller of pcie_wait_for_link_delay() specifies the time to wait after
the link becomes active.  When the downstream port doesn't support link
active reporting, obviously we can't tell when the link becomes active, so
we waited the worst-case time (1000 ms) plus 100 ms, ignoring the delay
from the caller.

Instead, wait for 1000 ms + the delay from the caller.
