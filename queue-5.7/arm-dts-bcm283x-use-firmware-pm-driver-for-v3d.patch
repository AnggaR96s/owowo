Subject: ARM: dts: bcm283x: Use firmware PM driver for V3D

From: Nicolas Saenz Julienne <nsaenzjulienne@suse.de>

[ Upstream commit 3ac395a5b3f3b678663fbb58381fdae2b1b57588 ]

The register based driver turned out to be unstable, specially on RPi3a+
but not limited to it. While a fix is being worked on, we roll back to
using firmware based scheme.

Fixes: e1dc2b2e1bef ("ARM: bcm283x: Switch V3D over to using the PM driver instead of firmware")
