Subject: RISC-V: Set maximum number of mapped pages correctly

From: Atish Patra <atish.patra@wdc.com>

[ Upstream commit d0d8aae64566b753c4330fbd5944b88af035f299 ]

Currently, maximum number of mapper pages are set to the pfn calculated
from the memblock size of the memblock containing kernel. This will work
until that memblock spans the entire memory. However, it will be set to
a wrong value if there are multiple memblocks defined in kernel
(e.g. with efi runtime services).

Set the the maximum value to the pfn calculated from dram size.
