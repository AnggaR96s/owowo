Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: qrb5165-rb5: fix uSD pins drive strength

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit abf2c58aaa776cf43daf0fc4fd20082c71583c6b ]

Lower drive strength for microSD data and CMD pins from 16 to 10. This
fixes spurious card removal issues observed on some boards. Also this
change allows us to re-enable 1.8V support, which seems to work with
lowered drive strength.
