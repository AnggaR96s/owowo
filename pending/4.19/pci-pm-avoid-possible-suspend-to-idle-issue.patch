Subject: PCI: PM: Avoid possible suspend-to-idle issue

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit d491f2b75237ef37d8867830ab7fad8d9659e853 ]

If a PCI driver leaves the device handled by it in D0 and calls
pci_save_state() on the device in its ->suspend() or ->suspend_late()
callback, it can expect the device to stay in D0 over the whole
s2idle cycle.  However, that may not be the case if there is a
spurious wakeup while the system is suspended, because in that case
pci_pm_suspend_noirq() will run again after pci_pm_resume_noirq()
which calls pci_restore_state(), via pci_pm_default_resume_early(),
so state_saved is cleared and the second iteration of
pci_pm_suspend_noirq() will invoke pci_prepare_to_sleep() which
may change the power state of the device.

To avoid that, add a new internal flag, skip_bus_pm, that will be set
by pci_pm_suspend_noirq() when it runs for the first time during the
given system suspend-resume cycle if the state of the device has
been saved already and the device is still in D0.  Setting that flag
will cause the next iterations of pci_pm_suspend_noirq() to set
state_saved for pci_pm_resume_noirq(), so that it always restores the
device state from the originally saved data, and avoid calling
pci_prepare_to_sleep() for the device.
