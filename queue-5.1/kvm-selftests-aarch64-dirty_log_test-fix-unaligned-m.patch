Subject: kvm: selftests: aarch64: dirty_log_test: fix unaligned memslot size

[ Upstream commit bffed38d4fb536c5d5d6c37846a7fb8fde1452fa ]

The memory slot size must be aligned to the host's page size. When
testing a guest with a 4k page size on a host with a 64k page size,
then 3 guest pages are not host page size aligned. Since we just need
a nearly arbitrary number of extra pages to ensure the memslot is not
aligned to a 64 host-page boundary for this test, then we can use
16, as that's 64k aligned, but not 64 * 64k aligned.

Fixes: 76d58e0f07ec ("KVM: fix KVM_CLEAR_DIRTY_LOG for memory slots of unaligned size", 2019-04-17)
