Subject: net/mlx5e: Fix calling wrong function to get inner vlan key and mask

From: Jianbo Liu <jianbol@mellanox.com>

[ Upstream commit 12d5cbf89a6599f6bbd7b373dba0e74b5bd9c505 ]

When flow_rule_match_XYZ() functions were first introduced,
flow_rule_match_cvlan() for inner vlan is missing.

In mlx5_core driver, to get inner vlan key and mask, flow_rule_match_vlan()
is just called, which is wrong because it obtains outer vlan information by
FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_VLAN.

This commit fixes this by changing to call flow_rule_match_cvlan() after
it's added.

Fixes: 8f2566225ae2 ("flow_offload: add flow_rule and flow_match structures and use them")
