Subject: staging: bcm2835-camera: Remove check of the number of buffers supplied

From: Dave Stevenson <dave.stevenson@raspberrypi.org>

commit bb8e97006d701ae725a177f8f322e5a75fa761b7 upstream.

Before commit "staging: bcm2835-camera: Remove V4L2/MMAL buffer remapping"
there was a need to ensure that there were sufficient buffers supplied from
the user to cover those being sent to the VPU (always 1).

Now the buffers are linked 1:1 between MMAL and V4L2,
therefore there is no need for that check, and indeed it is wrong
as there is no need to submit all the buffers before starting streaming.
