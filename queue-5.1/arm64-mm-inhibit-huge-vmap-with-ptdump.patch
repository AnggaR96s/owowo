Subject: arm64/mm: Inhibit huge-vmap with ptdump

[ Upstream commit 7ba36eccb3f83983a651efd570b4f933ecad1b5c ]

The arm64 ptdump code can race with concurrent modification of the
kernel page tables. At the time this was added, this was sound as:

* Modifications to leaf entries could result in stale information being
  logged, but would not result in a functional problem.

* Boot time modifications to non-leaf entries (e.g. freeing of initmem)
  were performed when the ptdump code cannot be invoked.

* At runtime, modifications to non-leaf entries only occurred in the
  vmalloc region, and these were strictly additive, as intermediate
  entries were never freed.

However, since commit:

  commit 324420bf91f6 ("arm64: add support for ioremap() block mappings")

... it has been possible to create huge mappings in the vmalloc area at
runtime, and as part of this existing intermediate levels of table my be
removed and freed.

It's possible for the ptdump code to race with this, and continue to
walk tables which have been freed (and potentially poisoned or
reallocated). As a result of this, the ptdump code may dereference bogus
addresses, which could be fatal.

Since huge-vmap is a TLB and memory optimization, we can disable it when
the runtime ptdump code is in use to avoid this problem.
