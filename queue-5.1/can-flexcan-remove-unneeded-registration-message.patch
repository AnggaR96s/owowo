Subject: can: flexcan: Remove unneeded registration message

[ Upstream commit eb503004a7e563d543c9cb869907156de7efe720 ]

Currently the following message is observed when the flexcan
driver is probed:

flexcan 2090000.flexcan: device registered (reg_base=(ptrval), irq=23)

The reason for printing 'ptrval' is explained at
Documentation/core-api/printk-formats.rst:

"Pointers printed without a specifier extension (i.e unadorned %p) are
hashed to prevent leaking information about the kernel memory layout. This
has the added benefit of providing a unique identifier. On 64-bit machines
the first 32 bits are zeroed. The kernel will print ``(ptrval)`` until it
gathers enough entropy."

Instead of passing %pK, which can print the correct address, simply
remove the entire message as it is not really that useful.
