Subject: Revert "brcmfmac: disable command decode in sdio_aos"

From: Douglas Anderson <dianders@chromium.org>

commit abdd5dcc00207e7c38680f3754d1bfffafff1093 upstream.

This reverts commit 29f6589140a10ece8c1d73f58043ea5b3473ab3e.

After that patch landed I find that my kernel log on
rk3288-veyron-minnie and rk3288-veyron-speedy is filled with:
brcmfmac: brcmf_sdio_bus_sleep: error while changing bus sleep state -110

This seems to happen every time the Broadcom WiFi transitions out of
sleep mode.  Reverting the commit fixes the problem for me, so that's
what this patch does.

Note that, in general, the justification in the original commit seemed
a little weak.  It looked like someone was testing on a SD card
controller that would sometimes die if there were CRC errors on the
bus.  This used to happen back in early days of dw_mmc (the controller
on my boards), but we fixed it.  Disabling a feature on all boards
just because one SD card controller is broken seems bad.
