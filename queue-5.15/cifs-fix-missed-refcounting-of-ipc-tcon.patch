Subject: cifs: fix missed refcounting of ipc tcon

From: Paulo Alcantara <pc@cjr.nz>

commit 65de262a209da0951eb9bc60b3b7faf3bbffa38a upstream.

Fix missed refcounting of IPC tcon used for getting domain-based DFS
root referrals.  We want to keep it alive as long as mount is active
and can be refreshed.  For standalone DFS root referrals it wouldn't
be a problem as the client ends up having an IPC tcon for both mount
and cache.

Fixes: c88f7dcd6d64 ("cifs: support nested dfs links over reconnect")
