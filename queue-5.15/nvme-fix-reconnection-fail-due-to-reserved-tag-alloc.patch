Subject: nvme: fix reconnection fail due to reserved tag allocation

From: Chunguang Xu <chunguang.xu@shopee.com>

[ Upstream commit de105068fead55ed5c07ade75e9c8e7f86a00d1d ]

We found a issue on production environment while using NVMe over RDMA,
admin_q reconnect failed forever while remote target and network is ok.
After dig into it, we found it may caused by a ABBA deadlock due to tag
allocation. In my case, the tag was hold by a keep alive request
waiting inside admin_q, as we quiesced admin_q while reset ctrl, so the
request maked as idle and will not process before reset success. As
fabric_q shares tagset with admin_q, while reconnect remote target, we
need a tag for connect command, but the only one reserved tag was held
by keep alive command which waiting inside admin_q. As a result, we
failed to reconnect admin_q forever. In order to fix this issue, I
think we should keep two reserved tags for admin queue.
