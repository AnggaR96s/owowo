Subject: scftorture: Fix distribution of short handler delays

From: Paul E. McKenney <paulmck@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 8106bddbab5f0ba180e6d693c7c1fc6926d57caa ]

The scftorture test module's scf_handler() function is supposed to provide
three different distributions of short delays (including "no delay") and
one distribution of long delays, if specified by the scftorture.longwait
module parameter.  However, the second of the two non-zero-wait short delays
is disabled due to the first such delay's "goto out" not being enclosed in
the "then" clause with the "udelay()".

This commit therefore adjusts the code to provide the intended set of
delays.
