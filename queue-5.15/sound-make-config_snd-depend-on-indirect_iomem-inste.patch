Subject: sound: Make CONFIG_SND depend on INDIRECT_IOMEM instead of UML

From: Julian Vetter <jvetter@kalrayinc.com>

[ Upstream commit ad6639f143a0b42d7fb110ad14f5949f7c218890 ]

When building for the UM arch and neither INDIRECT_IOMEM=y, nor
HAS_IOMEM=y is selected, it will fall back to the implementations from
asm-generic/io.h for IO memcpy. But these fall-back functions just do a
memcpy. So, instead of depending on UML, add dependency on 'HAS_IOMEM ||
INDIRECT_IOMEM'.
