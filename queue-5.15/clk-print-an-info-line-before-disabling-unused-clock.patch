Subject: clk: Print an info line before disabling unused clocks

From: Konrad Dybcio <konrad.dybcio@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 12ca59b91d04df32e41be5a52f0cabba912c11de ]

Currently, the regulator framework informs us before calling into
their unused cleanup paths, which eases at least some debugging. The
same could be beneficial for clocks, so that random shutdowns shortly
after most initcalls are done can be less of a guess.

Add a pr_info before disabling unused clocks to do so.
