Subject: firmware: arm_ffa: Fix uuid parameter to ffa_partition_probe

From: Sudeep Holla <sudeep.holla@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit f3c45c045e25ed52461829d2ce07954f72b6ad15 ]

While we pass uuid_null intentionally to ffa_partition_probe in
ffa_setup_partitions to get the count of the partitions, it must not be
uuid_null in ffa_partition_info_get which is used by the ffa_drivers
to fetch the specific partition info passing the UUID of the partition.

Fix ffa_partition_info_get by passing the received uuid down to
ffa_partition_probe so that the correct partition information is fetched.
