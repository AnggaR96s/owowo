Subject: ARM: dts: samsung: exynos4210-i9100: Unconditionally enable LDO12

From: Paul Cercueil <paul@crapouillou.net>

[ Upstream commit 84228d5e29dbc7a6be51e221000e1d122125826c ]

The kernel hangs for a good 12 seconds without any info being printed to
dmesg, very early in the boot process, if this regulator is not enabled.

Force-enable it to work around this issue, until we know more about the
underlying problem.
