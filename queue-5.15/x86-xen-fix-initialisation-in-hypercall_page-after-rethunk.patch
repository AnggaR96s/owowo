Subject: x86/xen: Fix initialisation in hypercall_page after rethunk

From: Ben Hutchings <ben@decadent.org.uk>

The hypercall_page is special and the RETs there should not be changed
into rethunk calls (but can have SLS mitigation).  Change the initial
instructions to ret + int3 padding, as was done in upstream commit
5b2fc51576ef "x86/ibt,xen: Sprinkle the ENDBR".
