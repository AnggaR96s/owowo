Subject: swap: comments get_swap_device() with usage rule

From: Huang Ying <ying.huang@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit a95722a047724ef75567381976a36f0e44230bd9 ]

The general rule to use a swap entry is as follows.

When we get a swap entry, if there aren't some other ways to prevent
swapoff, such as the folio in swap cache is locked, page table lock is
held, etc., the swap entry may become invalid because of swapoff.
Then, we need to enclose all swap related functions with
get_swap_device() and put_swap_device(), unless the swap functions
call get/put_swap_device() by themselves.

Add the rule as comments of get_swap_device().
