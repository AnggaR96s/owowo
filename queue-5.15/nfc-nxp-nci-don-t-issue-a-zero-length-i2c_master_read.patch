Subject: NFC: nxp-nci: Don't issue a zero length i2c_master_read()

From: Michael Walle <michael@walle.cc>

commit eddd95b9423946aaacb55cac6a9b2cea8ab944fc upstream.

There are packets which doesn't have a payload. In that case, the second
i2c_master_read() will have a zero length. But because the NFC
controller doesn't have any data left, it will NACK the I2C read and
-ENXIO will be returned. In case there is no payload, just skip the
second i2c master read.
