Subject: RISC-V: Align the shadow stack

From: Palmer Dabbelt <palmer@rivosinc.com>

[ Upstream commit b003b3b77d65133a0011ae3b7b255347438c12f6 ]

The standard RISC-V ABIs all require 16-byte stack alignment.  We're
only calling that one function on the shadow stack so I doubt it'd
result in a real issue, but might as well keep this lined up.

Fixes: 31da94c25aea ("riscv: add VMAP_STACK overflow detection")
