Subject: nfsd: zero out pointers after putting nfsd_files on COPY setup error

From: Jeff Layton <jlayton@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 1f0001d43d0c0ac2a19a34a914f6595ad97cbc1d ]

At first, I thought this might be a source of nfsd_file overputs, but
the current callers seem to avoid an extra put when nfsd4_verify_copy
returns an error.

Still, it's "bad form" to leave the pointers filled out when we don't
have a reference to them anymore, and that might lead to bugs later.
Zero them out as a defensive coding measure.
