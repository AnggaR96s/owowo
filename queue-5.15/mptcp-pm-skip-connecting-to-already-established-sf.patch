From: "Matthieu Baerts (NGI0)" <matttbe@kernel.org>

commit bc19ff57637ff563d2bdf2b385b48c41e6509e0d upstream.

The lookup_subflow_by_daddr() helper checks if there is already a
subflow connected to this address. But there could be a subflow that is
closing, but taking time due to some reasons: latency, losses, data to
process, etc.

If an ADD_ADDR is received while the endpoint is being closed, it is
better to try connecting to it, instead of rejecting it: the peer which
has sent the ADD_ADDR will not be notified that the ADD_ADDR has been
rejected for this reason, and the expected subflow will not be created
at the end.

This helper should then only look for subflows that are established, or
going to be, but not the ones being closed.

[ Conflicts in pm_netlink.c, due to commit 4638de5aefe5 ("mptcp: handle
  local addrs announced by userspace PMs"), not in this version, and
  changing the context. The same fix can still be applied. ]
