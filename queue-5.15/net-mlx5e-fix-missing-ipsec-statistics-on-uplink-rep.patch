Subject: net/mlx5e: Fix missing IPsec statistics on uplink representor

From: Raed Salem <raeds@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit 51ebf5db67f5c6aed79c05f1aa5137bdf5ca6614 ]

The cited patch added the IPsec support to uplink representor, however
as uplink representors have his private statistics where IPsec stats
is not part of it, that effectively makes IPsec stats hidden when uplink
representor stats queried.

Resolve by adding IPsec stats to uplink representor private statistics.

Fixes: 5589b8f1a2c7 ("net/mlx5e: Add IPsec support to uplink representor")
