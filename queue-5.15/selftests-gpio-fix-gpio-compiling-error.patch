Subject: selftests: gpio: fix gpio compiling error

From: Li Zhijian <lizhijian@cn.fujitsu.com>

[ Upstream commit 92a59d7f381d2caf69385bfa00590028e32eea26 ]

The gpio selftests build against the system includes rather than the
headers from the linux tree.  This results in the compile failing if
the system includes are outdated.

Prefer the headers from the linux tree, as per other selftests.

Fixes: 8bc395a6a2e2 ("selftests: gpio: rework and simplify test implementation")
