Subject: ASoC: fsl-asoc-card: Fix naming of AC'97 CODEC widgets

From: Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 242fc66ae6e1e2b8519daacc7590a73cd0e8a6e4 ]

The fsl-asoc-card AC'97 support currently tries to route to Playback and
Capture widgets provided by the AC'97 CODEC. This doesn't work since the
generic AC'97 driver registers with an "AC97" at the front of the stream
and hence widget names, update to reflect reality. It's not clear to me
if or how this ever worked.
