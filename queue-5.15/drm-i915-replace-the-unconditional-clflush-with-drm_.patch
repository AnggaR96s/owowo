[ Upstream commit ef7ec41f17cbc0861891ccc0634d06a0c8dcbf09 ]

Not all machines have clflush, so don't go assuming they do.
Not really sure why the clflush is even here since hwsp
is supposed to get snooped I thought.

Although in my case we're talking about a i830 machine where
render/blitter snooping is definitely busted. But it might
work for the hswp perhaps. Haven't really reverse engineered
that one fully.
