Subject: net: ethernet: mv643xx: Fix over zealous checking
 of_get_mac_address()

From: Andrew Lunn <andrew@lunn.ch>

[ Upstream commit 11f8e7c122ce013fa745029fa8c94c6db69c2e54 ]

There is often not a MAC address available in an EEPROM accessible by
Linux with Marvell devices. Instead the bootload has the MAC address
and directly programs it into the hardware. So don't consider an error
from of_get_mac_address() has fatal. However, the check was added for
the case where there is a MAC address in an the EEPROM, but the EEPROM
has not probed yet, and -EPROBE_DEFER is returned. In that case the
error should be returned. So make the check specific to this error
code.
