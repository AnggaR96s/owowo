Subject: bus: ti-sysc: Configure uart quirks for k3 SoC

From: Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>

[ Upstream commit 03a711d3cb83692733f865312f49e665c49de6de ]

Enable the uart quirks similar to the earlier SoCs. Let's assume we are
likely going to need a k3 specific quirk mask separate from the earlier
SoCs, so let's not start changing the revision register mask at this point.

Note that SYSC_QUIRK_LEGACY_IDLE will be needed until we can remove the
need for pm_runtime_irq_safe() from 8250_omap driver.
