Subject: ARM: dts: am5748: keep usb4_tm disabled

From: Romain Naour <romain.naour@skf.com>

[ Upstream commit 6a6d9ecff14a2a46c1deeffa3eb3825349639bdd ]

Commit bcbb63b80284 ("ARM: dts: dra7: Separate AM57 dtsi files")
disabled usb4_tm for am5748 devices since USB4 IP is not present
in this SoC.

The commit log explained the difference between AM5 and DRA7 families:

AM5 and DRA7 SoC families have different set of modules in them so the
SoC sepecific dtsi files need to be separated.

e.g. Some of the major differences between AM576 and DRA76

		DRA76x	AM576x

USB3		x
USB4		x
ATL		x
VCP		x
MLB		x
ISS		x
PRU-ICSS1		x
PRU-ICSS2		x

Then commit 176f26bcd41a ("ARM: dts: Add support for dra762 abz
package") removed usb4_tm part from am5748.dtsi and introcuded new
ti-sysc errors in dmesg:

ti-sysc 48940000.target-module: clock get error for fck: -2
ti-sysc: probe of 48940000.target-module failed with error -2

Fixes: 176f26bcd41a ("ARM: dts: Add support for dra762 abz package")
