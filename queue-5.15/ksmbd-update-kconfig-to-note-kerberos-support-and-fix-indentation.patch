Subject: ksmbd: update Kconfig to note Kerberos support and fix indentation

[ Upstream commit d280a958f8b2b62610c280ecdf35d780e7922620 ]

Fix indentation of server config options, and also since
support for very old, less secure, NTLM authentication was removed
(and quite a while ago), remove the mention of that in Kconfig, but
do note Kerberos (not just NTLMv2) which are supported and much
more secure.
