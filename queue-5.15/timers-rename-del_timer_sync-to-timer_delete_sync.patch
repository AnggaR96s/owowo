Subject: timers: Rename del_timer_sync() to timer_delete_sync()

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

[ Upstream commit 9b13df3fb64ee95e2397585404e442afee2c7d4f ]

The timer related functions do not have a strict timer_ prefixed namespace
which is really annoying.

Rename del_timer_sync() to timer_delete_sync() and provide del_timer_sync()
as a wrapper. Document that del_timer_sync() is not for new code.
