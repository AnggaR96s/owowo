Subject: ring-buffer: use READ_ONCE() to read cpu_buffer->commit_page in
 concurrent environment

From: linke li <lilinke99@qq.com>

[ Upstream commit f1e30cb6369251c03f63c564006f96a54197dcc4 ]

In function ring_buffer_iter_empty(), cpu_buffer->commit_page is read
while other threads may change it. It may cause the time_stamp that read
in the next line come from a different page. Use READ_ONCE() to avoid
having to reason about compiler optimizations now and in future.
