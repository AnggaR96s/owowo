Subject: tipc: fix wrong publisher node address in link publications

From: Jon Maloy <jmaloy@redhat.com>

commit 032062f363b4bf02b1d547f329aa5d97b6a17410 upstream.

When a link comes up we add its presence to the name table to make it
possible for users to subscribe for link up/down events. However, after
a previous call signature change the binding is wrongly published with
the peer node as publishing node, instead of the own node as it should
be. This has the effect that the command 'tipc name table show' will
list the link binding (service type 2) with node scope and a peer node
as originator, something that obviously is impossible.

We correct this bug here.
