Subject: nfsd: update create verifier comment

From: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 2336d696862186fd4a6ddd1ea0cb243b3e32847c ]

I don't know if that Solaris behavior matters any more or if it's still
possible to look up that bug ID any more.  The XFS behavior's definitely
still relevant, though; any but the most recent XFS filesystems will
lose the top bits.
