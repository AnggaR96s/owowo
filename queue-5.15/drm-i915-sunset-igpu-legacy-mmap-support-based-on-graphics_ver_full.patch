Subject: drm/i915: Sunset igpu legacy mmap support based on GRAPHICS_VER_FULL

commit 1acb34e7dd7720a1fff00cbd4d000ec3219dc9d6 upstream.

The intent of the version check in the mmap ioctl was to maintain
support for existing platforms (i.e., ADL/RPL and earlier), but drop
support on all future igpu platforms.  As we've seen on the dgpu side,
the hardware teams are using a more fine-grained numbering system for IP
version numbers these days, so it's possible the version number
associated with our next igpu could be some form of "12.xx" rather than
13 or higher.  Comparing against the full ver.release number will ensure
the intent of the check is maintained no matter what numbering the
hardware teams settle on.
