Subject: time: Fix references to _msecs_to_jiffies() handling of values

From: Miguel Ojeda <ojeda@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 92b043fd995a63a57aae29ff85a39b6f30cd440c ]

The details about the handling of the "normal" values were moved
to the _msecs_to_jiffies() helpers in commit ca42aaf0c861 ("time:
Refactor msecs_to_jiffies"). However, the same commit still mentioned
__msecs_to_jiffies() in the added documentation.

Thus point to _msecs_to_jiffies() instead.

Fixes: ca42aaf0c861 ("time: Refactor msecs_to_jiffies")
