[ Upstream commit 892a666fafa19ab04b5e948f6c92f98f1dafb489 ]

The for_each_perag*() set of macros are hacky in that some (i.e.
those based on sb_agcount) rely on the assumption that perag
iteration terminates naturally with a NULL perag at the specified
end_agno. Others allow for the final AG to have a valid perag and
require the calling function to clean up any potential leftover
xfs_perag reference on termination of the loop.

Aside from providing a subtly inconsistent interface, the former
variant is racy with growfs because growfs can create discoverable
post-eofs perags before the final superblock update that completes
the grow operation and increases sb_agcount. This leads to the
following assert failure (reproduced by xfs/104) in the perag free
path during unmount:

 XFS: Assertion failed: atomic_read(&pag->pag_ref) == 0, file: fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_ag.c, line: 195

This occurs because one of the many for_each_perag() loops in the
code that is expected to terminate with a NULL pag (and thus has no
post-loop xfs_perag_put() check) raced with a growfs and found a
non-NULL post-EOFS perag, but terminated naturally based on the
end_agno check without releasing the post-EOFS perag.

Rework the iteration logic to lift the agno check from the main for
loop conditional to the iteration helper function. The for loop now
purely terminates on a NULL pag and xfs_perag_next() avoids taking a
reference to any perag beyond end_agno in the first place.
