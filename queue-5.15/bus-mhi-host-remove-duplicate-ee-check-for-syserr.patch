Subject: bus: mhi: host: Remove duplicate ee check for syserr

From: Jeffrey Hugo <quic_jhugo@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit d469d9448a0f1a33c175d3280b1542fa0158ad7a ]

If we detect a system error via intvec, we only process the syserr if the
current ee is different than the last observed ee.  The reason for this
check is to prevent bhie from running multiple times, but with the single
queue handling syserr, that is not possible.

The check can cause an issue with device recovery.  If PBL loads a bad SBL
via BHI, but that SBL hangs before notifying the host of an ee change,
then issuing soc_reset to crash the device and retry (after supplying a
fixed SBL) will not recover the device as the host will observe a PBL->PBL
transition and not process the syserr.  The device will be stuck until
either the driver is reloaded, or the host is rebooted.  Instead, remove
the check so that we can attempt to recover the device.
