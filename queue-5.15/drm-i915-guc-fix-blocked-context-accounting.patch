Subject: drm/i915/guc: Fix blocked context accounting

From: Matthew Brost <matthew.brost@intel.com>

commit fc30a6764a54dea42291aeb7009bef7aa2fc1cd4 upstream.

Prior to this patch the blocked context counter was cleared on
init_sched_state (used during registering a context & resets) which is
incorrect. This state needs to be persistent or the counter can read the
incorrect value resulting in scheduling never getting enabled again.

Fixes: 62eaf0ae217d ("drm/i915/guc: Support request cancellation")
