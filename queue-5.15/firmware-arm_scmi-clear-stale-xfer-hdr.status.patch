Subject: firmware: arm_scmi: Clear stale xfer->hdr.status

From: Cristian Marussi <cristian.marussi@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit f6ca5059dc0d6608dc46070f48e396d611f240d6 ]

Stale error status reported from a previous message transaction must be
cleared before starting a new transaction to avoid being confusingly
reported in the following SCMI message dump traces.
