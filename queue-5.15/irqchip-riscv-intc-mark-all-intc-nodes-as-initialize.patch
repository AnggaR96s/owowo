Subject: irqchip/riscv-intc: Mark all INTC nodes as initialized

From: Anup Patel <apatel@ventanamicro.com>

[ Upstream commit e13cd66bd821be417c498a34928652db4ac6b436 ]

The RISC-V INTC local interrupts are per-HART (or per-CPU) so we
create INTC IRQ domain only for the INTC node belonging to the boot
HART. This means only the boot HART INTC node will be marked as
initialized and other INTC nodes won't be marked which results
downstream interrupt controllers (such as PLIC, IMSIC and APLIC
direct-mode) not being probed due to missing device suppliers.

To address this issue, we mark all INTC node for which we don't
create IRQ domain as initialized.
