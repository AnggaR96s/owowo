Subject: ARM: dts: qcom: sdx55: fix IPA interconnect definitions

From: Alex Elder <elder@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit c0d6316c238b1bd743108bd4b08eda364f47c7c9 ]

The first two interconnects defined for IPA on the SDX55 SoC are
really two parts of what should be represented as a single path
between IPA and system memory.

Fix this by combining the "memory-a" and "memory-b" interconnects
into a single "memory" interconnect.
