This reverts commit 6e99860de6f4e286c386f533c4d35e7e283803d4.

LTS 5.15 pulled in several lpfc "SLI Path split" patches.  The Path
Split mods were a 14-patch set, which refactors the driver from
to split the sli-3 hw (now eol) from the sli-4 hw and use sli4
structures natively. The patches are highly inter-related.

Given only some of the patches were included, it created a situation
where FLOGI's fail, thus SLI Ports can't start communication.

Reverting this patch as its a fix specific to the Path Split patches,
which were partially included and now being pulled from 5.15.
