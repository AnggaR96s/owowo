Subject: sched/fair: Move calculate of avg_load to a better location

From: zgpeng <zgpeng.linux@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 06354900787f25bf5be3c07a68e3cdbc5bf0fa69 ]

In calculate_imbalance function, when the value of local->avg_load is
greater than or equal to busiest->avg_load, the calculated sds->avg_load is
not used. So this calculation can be placed in a more appropriate position.
