Subject: PM: domains: Fix initialization of genpd's next_wakeup

From: Ulf Hansson <ulf.hansson@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 622d9b5577f19a6472db21df042fea8f5fefe244 ]

In the genpd governor we walk the list of child-domains to take into
account their next_wakeup. If the child-domain itself, doesn't have a
governor assigned to it, we can end up using the next_wakeup value before
it has been properly initialized. To prevent a possible incorrect behaviour
in the governor, let's initialize next_wakeup to KTIME_MAX.

Fixes: c79aa080fb0f ("PM: domains: use device's next wakeup to determine domain idle state")
