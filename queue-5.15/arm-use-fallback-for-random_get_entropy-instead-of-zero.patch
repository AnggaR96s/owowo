Subject: arm: use fallback for random_get_entropy() instead of zero

From: "Jason A. Donenfeld" <Jason@zx2c4.com>

commit ff8a8f59c99f6a7c656387addc4d9f2247d75077 upstream.

In the event that random_get_entropy() can't access a cycle counter or
similar, falling back to returning 0 is really not the best we can do.
Instead, at least calling random_get_entropy_fallback() would be
preferable, because that always needs to return _something_, even
falling back to jiffies eventually. It's not as though
random_get_entropy_fallback() is super high precision or guaranteed to
be entropic, but basically anything that's not zero all the time is
better than returning zero all the time.
