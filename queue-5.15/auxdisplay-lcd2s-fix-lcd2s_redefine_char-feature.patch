Subject: auxdisplay: lcd2s: Fix lcd2s_redefine_char() feature

From: Andy Shevchenko <andriy.shevchenko@linux.intel.com>

commit 4424c35ead667ba2e8de7ab8206da66453e6f728 upstream.

It seems that the lcd2s_redefine_char() has never been properly
tested. The buffer is filled by DEF_CUSTOM_CHAR command followed
by the character number (from 0 to 7), but immediately after that
these bytes are rewritten by the decoded hex stream.

Fix the index to fill the buffer after the command and number.

Fixes: 8c9108d014c5 ("auxdisplay: add a driver for lcd2s character display")
