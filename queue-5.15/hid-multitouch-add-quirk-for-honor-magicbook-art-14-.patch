Subject: HID: multitouch: Add quirk for HONOR MagicBook Art 14 touchpad

From: WangYuli <wangyuli@uniontech.com>

[ Upstream commit 7a5ab8071114344f62a8b1e64ed3452a77257d76 ]

The behavior of HONOR MagicBook Art 14 touchpad is not consistent
after reboots, as sometimes it reports itself as a touchpad, and
sometimes as a mouse.

Similarly to GLO-GXXX it is possible to call MT_QUIRK_FORCE_GET_FEATURE as a
workaround to force set feature in mt_set_input_mode() for such special touchpad
device.
