Subject: writeback: fix call of incorrect macro

From: Maxim Korotkov <korotkov.maxim.s@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 3e46c89c74f2c38e5337d2cf44b0b551adff1cb4 ]

 the variable 'history' is of type u16, it may be an error
 that the hweight32 macro was used for it
 I guess macro hweight16 should be used

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

Fixes: 2a81490811d0 ("writeback: implement foreign cgroup inode detection")
