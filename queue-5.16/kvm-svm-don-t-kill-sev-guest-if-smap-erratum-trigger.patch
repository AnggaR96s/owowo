Subject: KVM: SVM: Don't kill SEV guest if SMAP erratum triggers in usermode

From: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

[ Upstream commit cdf85e0c5dc766fc7fc779466280e454a6d04f87 ]

Inject a #GP instead of synthesizing triple fault to try to avoid killing
the guest if emulation of an SEV guest fails due to encountering the SMAP
erratum.  The injected #GP may still be fatal to the guest, e.g. if the
userspace process is providing critical functionality, but KVM should
make every attempt to keep the guest alive.
