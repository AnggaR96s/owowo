Subject: mtd: rawnand: davinci: Avoid duplicated page read

From: Paul Cercueil <paul@crapouillou.net>

commit 9c9d709965385de5a99f84b14bd5860e1541729e upstream.

The function nand_davinci_read_page_hwecc_oob_first() first reads the
OOB data, extracts the ECC information, programs the ECC hardware before
reading the actual data in a loop.

Right after the OOB data was read, it called nand_read_page_op() to
reset the read cursor to the beginning of the page. This caused the
first page to be read twice: in that call, and later in the loop.

Address that issue by changing the call to nand_read_page_op() to
nand_change_read_column_op(), which will only reset the read cursor.
