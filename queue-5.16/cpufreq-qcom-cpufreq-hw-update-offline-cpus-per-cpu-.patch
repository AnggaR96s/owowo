Subject: cpufreq: qcom-cpufreq-hw: Update offline CPUs per-cpu thermal
 pressure

From: Lukasz Luba <lukasz.luba@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit 93d9e6f93e1586fcc97498c764be2e8c8401f4bd ]

The thermal pressure signal gives information to the scheduler about
reduced CPU capacity due to thermal. It is based on a value stored in
a per-cpu 'thermal_pressure' variable. The online CPUs will get the
new value there, while the offline won't. Unfortunately, when the CPU
is back online, the value read from per-cpu variable might be wrong
(stale data).  This might affect the scheduler decisions, since it
sees the CPU capacity differently than what is actually available.

Fix it by making sure that all online+offline CPUs would get the
proper value in their per-cpu variable when there is throttling
or throttling is removed.
