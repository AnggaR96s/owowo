Subject: [PATCH] LSM: add missing hook to do_compat_readv_writev()

This patch addresses a flaw in LSM, where there is no mediation of readv() 
and writev() in for 32-bit compatible apps using a 64-bit kernel.

This bug was discovered and fixed initially in the native readv/writev 
code [1], but was not fixed in the compat code.  Thanks to Al for spotting 
this one.
