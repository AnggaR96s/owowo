Subject: NFS: restore module put when manager exits.

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>

commit 080abad71e99d2becf38c978572982130b927a28 upstream.

Commit f49169c97fce ("NFSD: Remove svc_serv_ops::svo_module") removed
calls to module_put_and_kthread_exit() from threads that acted as SUNRPC
servers and had a related svc_serv_ops structure.  This was correct.

It ALSO removed the module_put_and_kthread_exit() call from
nfs4_run_state_manager() which is NOT a SUNRPC service.

Consequently every time the NFSv4 state manager runs the module count
increments and won't be decremented.  So the nfsv4 module cannot be
unloaded.

So restore the module_put_and_kthread_exit() call.

Fixes: f49169c97fce ("NFSD: Remove svc_serv_ops::svo_module")
