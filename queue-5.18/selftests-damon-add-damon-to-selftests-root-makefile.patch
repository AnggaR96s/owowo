Subject: selftests/damon: add damon to selftests root Makefile

From: Yuanchu Xie <yuanchu@google.com>

[ Upstream commit 678f0cdc572c5fda940cb038d70eebb8d818adc8 ]

Currently the damon selftests are not built with the rest of the
selftests. We add damon to the list of targets.

Fixes: b348eb7abd09 ("mm/damon: add user space selftests")
