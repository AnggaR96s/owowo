Subject: ARM: dts: qcom: replace gcc PXO with pxo_board fixed clock

From: Ansuel Smith <ansuelsmth@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit eb9e93937756a05787977875830c0dc482cb57e0 ]

Replace gcc PXO phandle to pxo_board fixed clock declared in the dts.
gcc driver doesn't provide PXO_SRC as it's a fixed-clock. This cause a
kernel panic if any driver actually try to use it.
