Subject: IB/core: Fix wrong iterating on ports

From: Mohamad Heib <mohamadh@mellanox.com>

commit 1cbe866cbcb53338de33cf67262e73f9315a9725 upstream.

rdma_for_each_port is already incrementing the iterator's value it
receives therefore, after the first iteration the iterator is increased by
2 which eventually causing wrong queries and possible traces.

Fix the above by removing the old redundant incrementation that was used
before rdma_for_each_port() macro.
