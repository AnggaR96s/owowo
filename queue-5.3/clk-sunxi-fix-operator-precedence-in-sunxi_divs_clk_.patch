Subject: clk: sunxi: Fix operator precedence in sunxi_divs_clk_setup

From: Nathan Chancellor <natechancellor@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit afdc74ed2d57e86c10b1d6831339770a802bab9a ]

r375326 in Clang exposes an issue with operator precedence in
sunxi_div_clk_setup:

drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c:1083:30: warning: operator '?:' has lower
precedence than '|'; '|' will be evaluated first
[-Wbitwise-conditional-parentheses]
                                                 data->div[i].critical ?
                                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^
drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c:1083:30: note: place parentheses around
the '|' expression to silence this warning
                                                 data->div[i].critical ?
                                                                       ^
                                                                      )
drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c:1083:30: note: place parentheses around
the '?:' expression to evaluate it first
                                                 data->div[i].critical ?
                                                                       ^
                                                 (
1 warning generated.

It appears that the intention was for ?: to be evaluated first so that
CLK_IS_CRITICAL could be added to clkflags if the critical boolean was
set; right now, | is being evaluated first. Add parentheses around the
?: block to have it be evaluated first.
