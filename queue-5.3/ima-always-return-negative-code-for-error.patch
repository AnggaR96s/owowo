Subject: ima: always return negative code for error

From: Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>

[ Upstream commit f5e1040196dbfe14c77ce3dfe3b7b08d2d961e88 ]

integrity_kernel_read() returns the number of bytes read. If this is
a short read then this positive value is returned from
ima_calc_file_hash_atfm(). Currently this is only indirectly called from
ima_calc_file_hash() and this function only tests for the return value
being zero or nonzero and also doesn't forward the return value.
Nevertheless there's no point in returning a positive value as an error,
so translate a short read into -EINVAL.
