Subject: io_uring: Fix corrupted user_data

From: Pavel Begunkov <asml.silence@gmail.com>

commit 84d55dc5b9e57b513a702fbc358e1b5489651590 upstream.

There is a bug, where failed linked requests are returned not with
specified @user_data, but with garbage from a kernel stack.

The reason is that io_fail_links() uses req->user_data, which is
uninitialised when called from io_queue_sqe() on fail path.
