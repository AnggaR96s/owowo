Subject: DTS: ARM: gta04: introduce legacy spi-cs-high to make display work again

From: H. Nikolaus Schaller <hns@goldelico.com>

commit f1f028ff89cb0d37db299d48e7b2ce19be040d52 upstream.

commit 6953c57ab172 "gpio: of: Handle SPI chipselect legacy bindings"

did introduce logic to centrally handle the legacy spi-cs-high property
in combination with cs-gpios. This assumes that the polarity
of the CS has to be inverted if spi-cs-high is missing, even
and especially if non-legacy GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH is specified.

The DTS for the GTA04 was orginally introduced under the assumption
that there is no need for spi-cs-high if the gpio is defined with
proper polarity GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH.

This was not a problem until gpiolib changed the interpretation of
GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH and missing spi-cs-high.

The effect is that the missing spi-cs-high is now interpreted as CS being
low (despite GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH) which turns off the SPI interface when the
panel is to be programmed by the panel driver.

Therefore, we have to add the redundant and legacy spi-cs-high property
to properly activate CS.
