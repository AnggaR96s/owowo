Subject: ARM: dts: dir685: Drop spi-cpol from the display

From: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 2a7326caab479ca257c4b9bd67db42d1d49079bf ]

The D-Link DIR-685 had its clock polarity set as active
low using the special SPI "spi-cpol" property.

This is not correct: the datasheet clearly states:
"Fix SCL to GND level when not in use" which is
indicative that this line is active high.

After a recent fix making the GPIO-based SPI driver
force the clock line de-asserted at the beginning of
each SPI transaction this reared its ugly head: now
de-asserted was taken to mean the line should be
driven high, but it should be driven low.

Fix this up in the DTS file and the display works again.
