Subject: RDMA/mlx5: Clear old rate limit when closing QP

From: Rafi Wiener <rafiw@mellanox.com>

[ Upstream commit c8973df2da677f375f8b12b6eefca2f44c8884d5 ]

Before QP is closed it changes to ERROR state, when this happens
the QP was left with old rate limit that was already removed from
the table.

Fixes: 7d29f349a4b9 ("IB/mlx5: Properly adjust rate limit on QP state transitions")
