Subject: soc: qcom: socinfo: add two missing PMIC IDs

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 2fae3ecc70405b72ea6c923b216d34547559d6a9 ]

Add IDs for PMK8001 and PMI8996. They also fall in the list of
'duplicated' IDs, where the same index was used for multiple chips.

Fixes: 7fda2b0bfbd9 ("soc: qcom: socinfo: import PMIC IDs from pmic-spmi")
