Subject: platform/chrome: cros_ec_proto: Send command again when timeout occurs

From: Patryk Duda <pdk@semihalf.com>

commit 3abc16af57c9939724df92fcbda296b25cc95168 upstream.

Sometimes kernel is trying to probe Fingerprint MCU (FPMCU) when it
hasn't initialized SPI yet. This can happen because FPMCU is restarted
during system boot and kernel can send message in short window
eg. between sysjump to RW and SPI initialization.
