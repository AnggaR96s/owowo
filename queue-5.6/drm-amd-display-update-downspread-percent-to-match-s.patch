Subject: drm/amd/display: Update downspread percent to match spreadsheet for
 DCN2.1

From: Sung Lee <sung.lee@amd.com>

[ Upstream commit 668a6741f809f2d15d125cfe2b39661e8f1655ea ]

[WHY]
The downspread percentage was copied over from a previous version
of the display_mode_lib spreadsheet. This value has been updated,
and the previous value is too high to allow for such modes as
4K120hz. The new value is sufficient for such modes.

[HOW]
Update the value in dcn21_resource to match the spreadsheet.
