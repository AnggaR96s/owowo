Subject: ceph: flush release queue when handling caps for unknown inode
MIME-Version: 1.0

[ Upstream commit fb33c114d3ed5bdac230716f5b0a93b56b92a90d ]

It's possible for the VFS to completely forget about an inode, but for
it to still be sitting on the cap release queue. If the MDS sends the
client a cap message for such an inode, it just ignores it today, which
can lead to a stall of up to 5s until the cap release queue is flushed.

If we get a cap message for an inode that can't be located, then go
ahead and flush the cap release queue.
