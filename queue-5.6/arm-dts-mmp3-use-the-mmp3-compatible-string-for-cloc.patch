Subject: ARM: dts: mmp3: Use the MMP3 compatible string for /clocks

From: Lubomir Rintel <lkundrak@v3.sk>

[ Upstream commit ec7d12faf81de983efce8ff23f41c5d1bff14c41 ]

Clocks are in fact slightly different on MMP3. In particular, PLL2 is
fixed to a different frequency, there's an extra PLL3, and the GPU
clocks are configured differently.
