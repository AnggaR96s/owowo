Subject: xfs: correctly acount for reclaimable slabs

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit d59eadaea2b9945095d4d6d44367ebabd604395c ]

The XFS inode item slab actually reclaimed by inode shrinker
callbacks from the memory reclaim subsystem. These should be marked
as reclaimable so the mm subsystem has the full picture of how much
memory it can actually reclaim from the XFS slab caches.
