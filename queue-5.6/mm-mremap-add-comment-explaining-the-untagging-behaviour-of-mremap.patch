Subject: mm/mremap: Add comment explaining the untagging behaviour of mremap()

From: Will Deacon <will@kernel.org>

commit b2a84de2a2deb76a6a51609845341f508c518c03 upstream.

Commit dcde237319e6 ("mm: Avoid creating virtual address aliases in
brk()/mmap()/mremap()") changed mremap() so that only the 'old' address
is untagged, leaving the 'new' address in the form it was passed from
userspace. This prevents the unexpected creation of aliasing virtual
mappings in userspace, but looks a bit odd when you read the code.

Add a comment justifying the untagging behaviour in mremap().
