Subject: arm64: dts: mediatek: mt8183-kukui-jacuzzi: fix dsi unnecessary cells properties

From: Eugen Hristev <eugen.hristev@collabora.com>

commit 74543b303a9abfe4fa253d1fa215281baa05ff3a upstream.

dtbs_check throws a warning at the dsi node:
Warning (avoid_unnecessary_addr_size): /soc/dsi@14014000: unnecessary #address-cells/#size-cells without "ranges" or child "reg" property

Other DTS have a panel child node with a reg, so the parent dtsi
must have the address-cells and size-cells, however this specific DT
has the panel removed, but not the cells, hence the warning above.

If panel is deleted then the cells must also be deleted since they are
tied together, as the child node in this DT does not have a reg.
