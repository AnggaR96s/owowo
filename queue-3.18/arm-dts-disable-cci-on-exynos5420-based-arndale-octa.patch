Subject: ARM: dts: disable CCI on exynos5420 based arndale-octa

[ Upstream commit 25217fef355174209eff68c0eb438a8af5d7b01c ]

The arndale-octa board was giving "imprecise external aborts" during
boot-up with MCPM enabled. CCI enablement of the boot cluster was found
to be the cause of these aborts (possibly because the secure f/w was not
allowing it). Hence, disable CCI for the arndale-octa board.
