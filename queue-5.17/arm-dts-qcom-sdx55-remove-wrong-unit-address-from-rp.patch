Subject: ARM: dts: qcom: sdx55: remove wrong unit address from RPMH RSC clocks

From: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 97c246c825f73a018169834e56ffa9a89dea37a9 ]

The clock controller of RPMH RSC does not have 'reg' property, so should
not have unit address.

Fixes: bae2f5979c6e ("ARM: dts: qcom: Add SDX65 platform and MTP board support")
