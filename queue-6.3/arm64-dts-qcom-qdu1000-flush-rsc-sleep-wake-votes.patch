Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: qdu1000: Flush RSC sleep & wake votes

From: Konrad Dybcio <konrad.dybcio@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit ab033e7846f91953244d0626b28ce66412b813b3 ]

The rpmh driver will cache sleep and wake votes until the cluster
power-domain is about to enter idle, to avoid unnecessary writes. So
associate the apps_rsc with the cluster pd, so that it can be notified
about this event.

Without this, only AMC votes are being commited.
