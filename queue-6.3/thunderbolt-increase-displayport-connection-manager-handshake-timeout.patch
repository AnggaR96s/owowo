Subject: thunderbolt: Increase DisplayPort Connection Manager handshake timeout

From: Mika Westerberg <mika.westerberg@linux.intel.com>

commit b6d572aeb58a5e0be86bd51ea514c4feba996cc4 upstream.

It turns out that when plugging in VGA cable through USB-C to VGA/DVI
dongle the Connection Manager handshake can take longer time, at least
on Intel Titan Ridge based docks such as Dell WD91TB. This leads to
following error in the dmesg:

  thunderbolt 0000:00:0d.3: 3:10: DP tunnel activation failed, aborting

and the display stays blank (because we failed to establish the tunnel).
For this reason increase the timeout to 3s.
