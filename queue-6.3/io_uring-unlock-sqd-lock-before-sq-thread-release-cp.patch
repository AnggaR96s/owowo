Subject: io_uring: unlock sqd->lock before sq thread release CPU

From: Wenwen Chen <wenwen.chen@samsung.com>

[ Upstream commit 533ab73f5b5c95dcb4152b52d5482abcc824c690 ]

The sq thread actively releases CPU resources by calling the
cond_resched() and schedule() interfaces when it is idle. Therefore,
more resources are available for other threads to run.

There exists a problem in sq thread: it does not unlock sqd->lock before
releasing CPU resources every time. This makes other threads pending on
sqd->lock for a long time. For example, the following interfaces all
require sqd->lock: io_sq_offload_create(), io_register_iowq_max_workers()
and io_ring_exit_work().

Before the sq thread releases CPU resources, unlocking sqd->lock will
provide the user a better experience because it can respond quickly to
user requests.
