Subject: dt-bindings: perf: riscv,pmu: fix property dependencies

From: Conor Dooley <conor.dooley@microchip.com>

[ Upstream commit 4d276e4d3bb4a503e75086faab54f92c0a8fd368 ]

Seemingly I mis-implemented the dependencies here. The OpenSBI docs only
point out that the "riscv,event-to-mhpmcounters property is mandatory if
riscv,event-to-mhpmevent is present". It never claims that
riscv,event-to-mhpmcounters requires riscv,event-to-mhpmevent.

Drop the dependency of riscv,event-to-mhpmcounters on
riscv,event-to-mhpmevent.
