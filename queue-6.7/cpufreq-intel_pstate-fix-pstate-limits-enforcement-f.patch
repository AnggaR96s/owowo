Subject: cpufreq: intel_pstate: fix pstate limits enforcement for adjust_perf
 call back

From: Doug Smythies <dsmythies@telus.net>

[ Upstream commit f0a0fc10abb062d122db5ac4ed42f6d1ca342649 ]

There is a loophole in pstate limit clamping for the intel_cpufreq CPU
frequency scaling driver (intel_pstate in passive mode), schedutil CPU
frequency scaling governor, HWP (HardWare Pstate) control enabled, when
the adjust_perf call back path is used.

Fix it.
