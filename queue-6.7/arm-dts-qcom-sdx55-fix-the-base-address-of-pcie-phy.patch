Subject: ARM: dts: qcom: sdx55: Fix the base address of PCIe PHY

From: Manivannan Sadhasivam <manivannan.sadhasivam@linaro.org>

commit cc6fc55c7ae04ab19b3972f78d3a8b1be32bf533 upstream.

While convering the binding to new format, serdes address specified in the
old binding was used as the base address. This causes a boot hang as the
driver tries to access memory region outside of the specified address. Fix
it!
