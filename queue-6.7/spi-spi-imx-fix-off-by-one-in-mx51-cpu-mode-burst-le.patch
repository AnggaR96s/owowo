Subject: spi: spi-imx: fix off-by-one in mx51 CPU mode burst length

From: Adam Butcher <adam@jessamine.co.uk>

[ Upstream commit cf6d79a0f5769b5f4d9579ddaf88d2c30b03b873 ]

c712c05e46c8 ("spi: imx: fix the burst length at DMA mode and CPU mode")
corrects three cases of setting the ECSPI burst length but erroneously
leaves the in-range CPU case one bit to big (in that field a value of
0 means 1 bit).  The effect was that transmissions that should have been
8-bit bytes appeared as 9-bit causing failed communication with SPI
devices.
