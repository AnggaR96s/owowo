Subject: cifs: fix in logging in cifs_chan_update_iface

From: Shyam Prasad N <sprasad@microsoft.com>

[ Upstream commit 516eea97f92f1e7271f20835cfe9e73774b0f8cc ]

Recently, cifs_chan_update_iface was modified to not
remove an iface if a suitable replacement was not found.
With that, there were two conditionals that were exactly
the same. This change removes that extra condition check.

Also, fixed a logging in the same function to indicate
the correct message.
