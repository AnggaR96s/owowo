Subject: spi: intel-pci: Add support for Arrow Lake SPI serial flash

From: Mika Westerberg <mika.westerberg@linux.intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 8afe3c7fcaf72fca1e7d3dab16a5b7f4201ece17 ]

This adds the PCI ID of the Arrow Lake and Meteor Lake-S PCH SPI serial
flash controller. This one supports all the necessary commands Linux
SPI-NOR stack requires.
