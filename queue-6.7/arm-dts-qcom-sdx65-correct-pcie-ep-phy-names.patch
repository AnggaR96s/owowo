Subject: ARM: dts: qcom: sdx65: correct PCIe EP phy-names

From: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 94da379dba88c4cdd562bad21c9ba5656e5ed5df ]

Qualcomm PCIe endpoint bindings expect phy-names to be "pciephy":

  arch/arm/boot/dts/qcom/qcom-sdx65-mtp.dtb: pcie-ep@1c00000: phy-names:0: 'pciephy' was expected
