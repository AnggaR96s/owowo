Subject: iomap: clear the per-folio dirty bits on all writeback failures

From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>

[ Upstream commit 7ea1d9b4a840c2dd01d1234663d4a8ef256cfe39 ]

write_cache_pages always clear the page dirty bit before calling into the
file systems, and leaves folios with a writeback failure without the
dirty bit after return.  We also clear the per-block writeback bits for
writeback failures unless no I/O has submitted, which will leave the
folio in an inconsistent state where it doesn't have the folio dirty,
but one or more per-block dirty bits.  This seems to be due the place
where the iomap_clear_range_dirty call was inserted into the existing
not very clearly structured code when adding per-block dirty bit support
and not actually intentional.  Switch to always clearing the dirty on
writeback failure.

Fixes: 4ce02c679722 ("iomap: Add per-block dirty state tracking to improve performance")
