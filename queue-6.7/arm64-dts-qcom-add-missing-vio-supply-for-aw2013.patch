Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: Add missing vio-supply for AW2013

From: Stephan Gerhold <stephan@gerhold.net>

commit cc1ec484f2d0f464ad11b56fe3de2589c23f73ec upstream.

Add the missing vio-supply to all usages of the AW2013 LED controller
to ensure that the regulator needed for pull-up of the interrupt and
I2C lines is really turned on. While this seems to have worked fine so
far some of these regulators are not guaranteed to be always-on. For
example, pm8916_l6 is typically turned off together with the display
if there aren't any other devices (e.g. sensors) keeping it always-on.
