Subject: arm64: defconfig: select INTERCONNECT_QCOM_SM6115 as built-in

From: Dmitry Baryshkov <dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit b052c7fe3cb787282ab7e1fa088c794a1eb7fdb0 ]

Enable CONFIG_INTERCONNECT_QCOM_SM6115 as built-in to enable the
interconnect driver for the SoC used on Qualcomm Robotics RB2 board.
Building as built-in is required as on this platform interconnects are
required to bring up the console.
