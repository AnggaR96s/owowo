Subject: Revert "usb: gadget: u_ether: Replace netif_stop_queue with netif_device_detach"

From: Ferry Toth <ftoth@exalondelft.nl>

commit c50814a288dcee687285abc0cf935e9fe8928e59 upstream.

This reverts commit f49449fbc21e7e9550a5203902d69c8ae7dfd918.

This commit breaks u_ether on some setups (at least Merrifield). The fix
"usb: gadget: u_ether: Re-attach netif device to mirror detachment" party
restores u-ether. However the netif usb: remains up even usb is switched
from device to host mode. This creates problems for user space as the
interface remains in the routing table while not realy present and network
managers (connman) not detecting a network change.

Various attempts to find the root cause were unsuccesful up to now. Therefore
revert until a solution is found.
