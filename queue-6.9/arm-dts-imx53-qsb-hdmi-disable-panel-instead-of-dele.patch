Subject: arm: dts: imx53-qsb-hdmi: Disable panel instead of deleting node

From: Liu Ying <victor.liu@nxp.com>

[ Upstream commit bcdea3e81ea51c9e89e3b11aac2612e1b4330bee ]

We cannot use /delete-node/ directive to delete a node in a DT
overlay.  The node won't be deleted effectively.  Instead, set
the node's status property to "disabled" to achieve something
similar.
