Subject: LSM: Check for NULL cred-security on free

From: James Morris <james.morris@microsoft.com>

commit a5795fd38ee8194451ba3f281f075301a3696ce2 upstream.

From: Casey Schaufler <casey@schaufler-ca.com>

Check that the cred security blob has been set before trying
to clean it up. There is a case during credential initialization
that could result in this.
