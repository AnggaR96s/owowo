Subject: irda: Only insert new objects into the global database via setsockopt
To: stable@vger.kernel.org
Message-ID: <1536074645-14160-3-git-send-email-tyhicks@canonical.com>

From: Tyler Hicks <tyhicks@canonical.com>

The irda_setsockopt() function conditionally allocates memory for a new
self->ias_object or, in some cases, reuses the existing
self->ias_object. Existing objects were incorrectly reinserted into the
LM_IAS database which corrupted the doubly linked list used for the
hashbin implementation of the LM_IAS database. When combined with a
memory leak in irda_bind(), this issue could be leveraged to create a
use-after-free vulnerability in the hashbin list. This patch fixes the
issue by only inserting newly allocated objects into the database.

CVE-2018-6555
