Subject: cifs: Fix a race condition with cifs_echo_request

From: Ronnie Sahlberg <lsahlber@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit f2caf901c1b7ce65f9e6aef4217e3241039db768 ]

There is a race condition with how we send (or supress and don't send)
smb echos that will cause the client to incorrectly think the
server is unresponsive and thus needs to be reconnected.

Summary of the race condition:
 1) Daisy chaining scheduling creates a gap.
 2) If traffic comes unfortunate shortly after
    the last echo, the planned echo is suppressed.
 3) Due to the gap, the next echo transmission is delayed
    until after the timeout, which is set hard to twice
    the echo interval.

This is fixed by changing the timeouts from 2 to three times the echo interval.
