Subject: arm64: remove no-op -p linker flag

(commit 1a381d4a0a9a0f999a13faaba22bf6b3fc80dcb9 upstream)

Linking the ARM64 defconfig kernel with LLVM lld fails with the error:

  ld.lld: error: unknown argument: -p
  Makefile:1015: recipe for target 'vmlinux' failed

Without this flag, the ARM64 defconfig kernel successfully links with
lld and boots on Dragonboard 410c.

After digging through binutils source and changelogs, it turns out that
-p is only relevant to ancient binutils installations targeting 32-bit
ARM.  binutils accepts -p for AArch64 too, but it's always been
undocumented and silently ignored.  A comment in
ld/emultempl/aarch64elf.em explains that it's "Only here for backwards
compatibility".

Since this flag is a no-op on ARM64, we can safely drop it.
