Subject: drm/i915/cmdparser: Ignore Length operands during command matching

From: Jon Bloomfield <jon.bloomfield@intel.com>

commit 926abff21a8f29ef159a3ac893b05c6e50e043c3 upstream.

Some of the gen instruction macros (e.g. MI_DISPLAY_FLIP) have the
length directly encoded in them. Since these are used directly in
the tables, the Length becomes part of the comparison used for
matching during parsing. Thus, if the cmd being parsed has a
different length to that in the table, it is not matched and the
cmd is accepted via the default variable length path.

Fix by masking out everything except the Opcode in the cmd tables
