Subject: ARM: dts: imx53-voipac-dmm-668: Fix memory node duplication

From: Fabio Estevam <festevam@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 998a84c27a7f3f9133d32af64e19c05cec161a1a ]

imx53-voipac-dmm-668 has two memory nodes, but the correct representation
would be to use a single one with two reg entries - one for each RAM chip
select, so fix it accordingly.
