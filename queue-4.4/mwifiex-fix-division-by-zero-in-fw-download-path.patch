Subject: mwifiex: fix division by zero in fw download path

From: Johan Hovold <johan@kernel.org>

commit 89f8765a11d8df49296d92c404067f9b5c58ee26 upstream.

Add the missing endpoint sanity checks to probe() to avoid division by
zero in mwifiex_write_data_sync() in case a malicious device has broken
descriptors (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing).

Only add checks for the firmware-download boot stage, which require both
command endpoints, for now. The driver looks like it will handle a
missing endpoint during normal operation without oopsing, albeit not
very gracefully as it will try to submit URBs to the default pipe and
fail.

Note that USB core will reject URBs submitted for endpoints with zero
wMaxPacketSize but that drivers doing packet-size calculations still
need to handle this (cf. commit 2548288b4fb0 ("USB: Fix: Don't skip
endpoint descriptors with maxpacket=0")).
