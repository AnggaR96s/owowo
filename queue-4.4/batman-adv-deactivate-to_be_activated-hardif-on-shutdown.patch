commit f2d23861b818d08bcd15cc1612ae94aa33b3931c upstream.

The shutdown of an batman-adv interface can happen with one of its slave
interfaces still being in the BATADV_IF_TO_BE_ACTIVATED state. A possible
reason for it is that the routing algorithm BATMAN_V was selected and
batadv_schedule_bat_ogm was not yet called for this interface. This slave
interface still has to be set to BATADV_IF_INACTIVE or the batman-adv
interface will never reduce its usage counter and thus never gets shutdown.

This problem can be simulated via:

    $ modprobe dummy
    $ modprobe batman-adv routing_algo=BATMAN_V
    $ ip link add bat0 type batadv
    $ ip link set dummy0 master bat0
    $ ip link set dummy0 up
    $ ip link del bat0
    unregister_netdevice: waiting for bat0 to become free. Usage count = 3
