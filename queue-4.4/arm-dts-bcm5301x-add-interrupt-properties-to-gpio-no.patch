Subject: ARM: dts: BCM5301X: Add interrupt properties to GPIO node

From: Florian Fainelli <f.fainelli@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 40f7342f0587639e5ad625adaa15efdd3cffb18f ]

The GPIO controller is also an interrupt controller provider and is
currently missing the appropriate 'interrupt-controller' and
'#interrupt-cells' properties to denote that.

Fixes: fb026d3de33b ("ARM: BCM5301X: Add Broadcom's bus-axi to the DTS file")
