Subject: ARM: dts: omap5: Fix dual-role mode on Super-Speed port

From: Roger Quadros <rogerq@ti.com>

[ Upstream commit a763ecc15d0e37c3a15ff6825183061209832685 ]

OMAP5's Super-Speed USB port has a software mailbox register
that needs to be fed with VBUS and ID events from an external
VBUS/ID comparator.

Without this, Host role will not work correctly.

Fixes: 656c1a65ab55 ("ARM: dts: omap5: enable OTG role for DWC3 controller")
