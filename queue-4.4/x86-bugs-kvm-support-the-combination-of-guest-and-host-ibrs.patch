Subject: x86/bugs, KVM: Support the combination of guest and host IBRS

From: Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>

commit 5cf687548705412da47c9cec342fd952d71ed3d5 upstream.

A guest may modify the SPEC_CTRL MSR from the value used by the
kernel. Since the kernel doesn't use IBRS, this means a value of zero is
what is needed in the host.

But the 336996-Speculative-Execution-Side-Channel-Mitigations.pdf refers to
the other bits as reserved so the kernel should respect the boot time
SPEC_CTRL value and use that.

This allows to deal with future extensions to the SPEC_CTRL interface if
any at all.

Note: This uses wrmsrl() instead of native_wrmsl(). I does not make any
difference as paravirt will over-write the callq *0xfff.. with the wrmsrl
assembler code.

 missing bits]
