Subject: fuse: fix page stealing

From: Miklos Szeredi <mszeredi@redhat.com>

commit 712a951025c0667ff00b25afc360f74e639dfabe upstream.

It is possible to trigger a crash by splicing anon pipe bufs to the fuse
device.

The reason for this is that anon_pipe_buf_release() will reuse buf->page if
the refcount is 1, but that page might have already been stolen and its
flags modified (e.g. PG_lru added).

This happens in the unlikely case of fuse_dev_splice_write() getting around
to calling pipe_buf_release() after a page has been stolen, added to the
page cache and removed from the page cache.

Fix by calling pipe_buf_release() right after the page was inserted into
the page cache.  In this case the page has an elevated refcount so any
release function will know that the page isn't reusable.
