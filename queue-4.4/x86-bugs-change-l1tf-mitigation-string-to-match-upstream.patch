Subject: x86/bugs: Change L1TF mitigation string to match upstream

From: Ben Hutchings <ben@decadent.org.uk>

Commit 72c6d2db64fa "x86/litf: Introduce vmx status variable" upstream
changed "Page Table Inversion" to "PTE Inversion".  That was part of
the implementation of additional mitigations for VMX which haven't
been applied to this branch.  Just change this string to be consistent
and match documentation.
