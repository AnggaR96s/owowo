Subject: extcon: usb-gpio: Don't miss event during suspend/resume

From: Roger Quadros <rogerq@ti.com>

commit 04c080080855ce84dcd490a2e04805608a21085d upstream.

Pin state might have changed during suspend/resume while
our interrupts were disabled and if device doesn't support wakeup.

Scan for change during resume for such case.
