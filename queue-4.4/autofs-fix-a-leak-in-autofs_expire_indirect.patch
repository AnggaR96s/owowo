Subject: autofs: fix a leak in autofs_expire_indirect()

From: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>

[ Upstream commit 03ad0d703df75c43f78bd72e16124b5b94a95188 ]

if the second call of should_expire() in there ends up
grabbing and returning a new reference to dentry, we need
to drop it before continuing.
