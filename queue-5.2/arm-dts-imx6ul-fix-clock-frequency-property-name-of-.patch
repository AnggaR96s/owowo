Subject: ARM: dts: imx6ul: fix clock frequency property name of I2C buses
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

[ Upstream commit 2ca99396333999b9b5c5b91b36cbccacfe571aaf ]

A few boards set clock frequency of their I2C buses with
"clock_frequency" property. The right property is "clock-frequency".
