Subject: parisc: Add archclean Makefile target

From: James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com>

commit f2c5ed0dd5004c2cff5c0e3d430a107576fcc17f upstream.

Apparently we don't have an archclean target in our
arch/parisc/Makefile, so files in there never get cleaned out by make
mrproper.  This, in turn means that the sizes.h file in
arch/parisc/boot/compressed never gets removed and worse, when you
transition to an O=build/parisc[64] build model it overrides the
generated file.  The upshot being my bzImage was building with a SZ_end
that was too small.

I fixed it by making mrproper clean everything.
