Subject: soc: qcom: rpmpd: fixup rpmpd set performance state

[ Upstream commit 8b3344422f097debe52296b87a39707d56ca3abe ]

Remoteproc q6v5-mss calls set_performance_state with INT_MAX on
rpmpd. This is currently ignored since it is greater than the
max supported state. Fixup rpmpd state to max if the required
state is greater than all the supported states.

Fixes: 075d3db8d10d ("soc: qcom: rpmpd: Add support for get/set performance state")
