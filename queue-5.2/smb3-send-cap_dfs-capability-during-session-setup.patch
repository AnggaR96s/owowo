Subject: smb3: send CAP_DFS capability during session setup

From: Steve French <stfrench@microsoft.com>

commit 8d33096a460d5b9bd13300f01615df5bb454db10 upstream.

We had a report of a server which did not do a DFS referral
because the session setup Capabilities field was set to 0
(unlike negotiate protocol where we set CAP_DFS).  Better to
send it session setup in the capabilities as well (this also
more closely matches Windows client behavior).
