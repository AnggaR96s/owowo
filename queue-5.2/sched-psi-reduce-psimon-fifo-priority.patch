Subject: sched/psi: Reduce psimon FIFO priority

[ Upstream commit 14f5c7b46a41a595fc61db37f55721714729e59e ]

PSI defaults to a FIFO-99 thread, reduce this to FIFO-1.

FIFO-99 is the very highest priority available to SCHED_FIFO and
it not a suitable default; it would indicate the psi work is the
most important work on the machine.

Since Real-Time tasks will have pre-allocated memory and locked it in
place, Real-Time tasks do not care about PSI. All it needs is to be
above OTHER.
