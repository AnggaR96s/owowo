Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404-evb: fix l3 min voltage

[ Upstream commit 887b528c958f40b064d53edd0bfa9fea3a69eccd ]

The current l3 min voltage level is not supported by
the regulator (the voltage is not a multiple of the regulator step size),
so a driver requesting this exact voltage would fail, see discussion in:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/comment/22461199/

It was agreed upon to set a min voltage level that is a multiple of the
regulator step size.

There was actually a patch sent that did this:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10819313/

However, the commit 331ab98f8c4a ("arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404:
Fix voltages l3") that was applied is not identical to that patch.
