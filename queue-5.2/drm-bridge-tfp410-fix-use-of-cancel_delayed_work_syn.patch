Subject: drm/bridge: tfp410: fix use of cancel_delayed_work_sync

[ Upstream commit b1622cb3be4557fd086831ca7426eafe5f1acc2e ]

We use delayed_work in HPD handling, and cancel any scheduled work in
tfp410_fini using cancel_delayed_work_sync(). However, we have only
initialized the delayed work if we actually have a HPD interrupt
configured in the DT, but in the tfp410_fini, we always cancel the work,
possibly causing a WARN().

Fix this by doing the cancel only if we actually had the delayed work
set up.
