Subject: mm: fix struct page layout on 32-bit systems

From: Matthew Wilcox (Oracle) <willy@infradead.org>

commit 9ddb3c14afba8bc5950ed297f02d4ae05ff35cd1 upstream.

32-bit architectures which expect 8-byte alignment for 8-byte integers and
need 64-bit DMA addresses (arm, mips, ppc) had their struct page
inadvertently expanded in 2019.  When the dma_addr_t was added, it forced
the alignment of the union to 8 bytes, which inserted a 4 byte gap between
'flags' and the union.

Fix this by storing the dma_addr_t in one or two adjacent unsigned longs.
This restores the alignment to that of an unsigned long.  We always
store the low bits in the first word to prevent the PageTail bit from
being inadvertently set on a big endian platform.  If that happened,
get_user_pages_fast() racing against a page which was freed and
reallocated to the page_pool could dereference a bogus compound_head(),
which would be hard to trace back to this cause.
