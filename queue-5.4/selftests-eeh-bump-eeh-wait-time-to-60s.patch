Subject: selftests/eeh: Bump EEH wait time to 60s

From: Oliver O'Halloran <oohall@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 414f50434aa2463202a5b35e844f4125dd1a7101 ]

Some newer cards supported by aacraid can take up to 40s to recover
after an EEH event. This causes spurious failures in the basic EEH
self-test since the current maximim timeout is only 30s.

Fix the immediate issue by bumping the timeout to a default of 60s,
and allow the wait time to be specified via an environmental variable
(EEH_MAX_WAIT).
