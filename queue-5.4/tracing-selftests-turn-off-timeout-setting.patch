Subject: tracing/selftests: Turn off timeout setting

From: Steven Rostedt (VMware) <rostedt@goodmis.org>

[ Upstream commit b43e78f65b1d35fd3e13c7b23f9b64ea83c9ad3a ]

As the ftrace selftests can run for a long period of time, disable the
timeout that the general selftests have. If a selftest hangs, then it
probably means the machine will hang too.
