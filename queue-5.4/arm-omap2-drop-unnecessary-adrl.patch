Subject: ARM: OMAP2+: drop unnecessary adrl

From: Stefan Agner <stefan@agner.ch>

commit d85d5247885ef2e8192287b895c2e381fa931b0b upstream.

The adrl instruction has been introduced with commit dd31394779aa ("ARM:
omap3: Thumb-2 compatibility for sleep34xx.S"), back when this assembly
file was considerably longer. Today adr seems to have enough reach, even
when inserting about 60 instructions between the use site and the label.
Replace adrl with conventional adr instruction.

This allows to build this file using Clang's integrated assembler (which
does not support the adrl pseudo instruction).
