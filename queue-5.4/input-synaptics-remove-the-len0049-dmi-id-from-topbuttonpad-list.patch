Subject: Input: synaptics - remove the LEN0049 dmi id from topbuttonpad list

From: Benjamin Tissoires <benjamin.tissoires@redhat.com>

commit 5179a9dfa9440c1781816e2c9a183d1d2512dc61 upstream.

The Yoga 11e is using LEN0049, but it doesn't have a trackstick.

Thus, there is no need to create a software top buttons row.

However, it seems that the device works under SMBus, so keep it as part
of the smbus_pnp_ids.
