Subject: ARM: 9197/1: spectre-bhb: fix loop8 sequence for Thumb2

From: Ard Biesheuvel <ardb@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 3cfb3019979666bdf33a1010147363cf05e0f17b ]

In Thumb2, 'b . + 4' produces a branch instruction that uses a narrow
encoding, and so it does not jump to the following instruction as
expected. So use W(b) instead.

Fixes: 6c7cb60bff7a ("ARM: fix Thumb2 regression with Spectre BHB")
