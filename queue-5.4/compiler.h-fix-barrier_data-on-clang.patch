Subject: compiler.h: fix barrier_data() on clang

From: Arvind Sankar <nivedita@alum.mit.edu>

[ Upstream commit 3347acc6fcd4ee71ad18a9ff9d9dac176b517329 ]

Commit 815f0ddb346c ("include/linux/compiler*.h: make compiler-*.h
mutually exclusive") neglected to copy barrier_data() from
compiler-gcc.h into compiler-clang.h.

The definition in compiler-gcc.h was really to work around clang's more
aggressive optimization, so this broke barrier_data() on clang, and
consequently memzero_explicit() as well.

For example, this results in at least the memzero_explicit() call in
lib/crypto/sha256.c:sha256_transform() being optimized away by clang.

Fix this by moving the definition of barrier_data() into compiler.h.

Also move the gcc/clang definition of barrier() into compiler.h,
__memory_barrier() is icc-specific (and barrier() is already defined
using it in compiler-intel.h) and doesn't belong in compiler.h.
