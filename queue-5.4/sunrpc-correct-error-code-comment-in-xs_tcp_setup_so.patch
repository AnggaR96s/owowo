Subject: SUNRPC: correct error code comment in xs_tcp_setup_socket()

From: Calum Mackay <calum.mackay@oracle.com>

[ Upstream commit 8c71139d9f84c1963b0a416941244502a20a7e52 ]

This comment was introduced by commit 6ea44adce915
("SUNRPC: ensure correct error is reported by xs_tcp_setup_socket()").

I believe EIO was a typo at the time: it should have been EAGAIN.

Subsequently, commit 0445f92c5d53 ("SUNRPC: Fix disconnection races")
changed that to ENOTCONN.

Rather than trying to keep the comment here in sync with the code in
xprt_force_disconnect(), make the point in a non-specific way.
