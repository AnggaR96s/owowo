Subject: selftests/bpf: Avoid running unprivileged tests with alignment
 requirements

[ Upstream commit c77b0589ca29ad1859fe7d7c1ecd63c0632379fa ]

Some architectures have strict alignment requirements. In that case,
the BPF verifier detects if a program has unaligned accesses and
rejects them. A user can pass BPF_F_ANY_ALIGNMENT to a program to
override this check. That, however, will only work when a privileged
user loads a program. An unprivileged user loading a program with this
flag will be rejected prior entering the verifier.

Hence, it does not make sense to load unprivileged programs without
strict alignment when testing the verifier. This patch avoids exactly
that.
