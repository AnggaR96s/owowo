Subject: arm64: Run ARCH_WORKAROUND_2 enabling code on all CPUs

From: Marc Zyngier <maz@kernel.org>

commit 39533e12063be7f55e3d6ae21ffe067799d542a4 upstream.

Commit 606f8e7b27bf ("arm64: capabilities: Use linear array for
detection and verification") changed the way we deal with per-CPU errata
by only calling the .matches() callback until one CPU is found to be
affected. At this point, .matches() stop being called, and .cpu_enable()
will be called on all CPUs.

This breaks the ARCH_WORKAROUND_2 handling, as only a single CPU will be
mitigated.

In order to address this, forcefully call the .matches() callback from a
.cpu_enable() callback, which brings us back to the original behaviour.

Fixes: 606f8e7b27bf ("arm64: capabilities: Use linear array for detection and verification")
