Subject: include/linux/sched/mm.h: use rcu_dereference in in_vfork()

From: Matthew Wilcox (Oracle) <willy@infradead.org>

[ Upstream commit 149fc787353f65b7e72e05e7b75d34863266c3e2 ]

Fix a sparse warning by using rcu_dereference().  Technically this is a
bug and a sufficiently aggressive compiler could reload the `real_parent'
pointer outside the protection of the rcu lock (and access freed memory),
but I think it's pretty unlikely to happen.
