Subject: arm64: dts: clearfog-gt-8k: set gigabit PHY reset deassert delay

From: Russell King <rmk+kernel@armlinux.org.uk>

[ Upstream commit 46f94c7818e7ab82758fca74935ef3d454340b4e ]

If the mv88e6xxx DSA driver is built as a module, it causes the
ethernet driver to re-probe when it's loaded. This in turn causes
the gigabit PHY to be momentarily reset and reprogrammed. However,
we attempt to reprogram the PHY immediately after deasserting reset,
and the PHY ignores the writes.

This results in the PHY operating in the wrong mode, and the copper
link states down.

Set a reset deassert delay of 10ms for the gigabit PHY to avoid this.
