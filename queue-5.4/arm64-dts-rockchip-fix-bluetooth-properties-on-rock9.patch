Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix bluetooth properties on Rock960 boards

From: Heiko Stuebner <heiko@sntech.de>

[ Upstream commit ea74528aaea5a1dfc8e3de09ef2af37530eca526 ]

The expected clock-name is different, and extclk also is deprecated
in favor of txco for clocks that are not crystals.

So fix it to match the binding.
