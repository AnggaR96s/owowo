Subject: regmap: allow to define reg_update_bits for no bus configuration

From: Ansuel Smith <ansuelsmth@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 02d6fdecb9c38de19065f6bed8d5214556fd061d ]

Some device requires a special handling for reg_update_bits and can't use
the normal regmap read write logic. An example is when locking is
handled by the device and rmw operations requires to do atomic operations.
Allow to declare a dedicated function in regmap_config for
reg_update_bits in no bus configuration.
