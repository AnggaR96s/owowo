From: Matthias Schiffer <matthias.schiffer@ew.tq-group.com>

This reverts commit d0c69c722ff16ce2481a5e0932c6d5b172109f21 which is
commit 0b4edf111870b83ea77b1d7e16b8ceac29f9f388 upstream.

The reverted commit completely breaks MMC on the AM33xx/AM437x for
multiple reasons:

- The changed compatible strings ti,am335-sdhci and ti,am437-sdhci
  aren't supported on Linux 5.4 at all, so no driver is found
- Even when additionally backporting the support for these compatible
  strings in the sdhci-omap driver, I could not the the MMC interfaces
  to work on our TQMa335x SoM - the interface would time out during card
  initialization for both an eMMC and an SD card.

I did not investigate the cause of the timeouts further, and instead
just reverted the commit - switching to a different MMC driver in a stable
kernel seems like a rather risky change unless it's thoroughly tested,
which has obviously not happened in this case.

The reverted commit is also given as a Stable-dep-of commit 2eb502f496f7
("ARM: dts: am33xx: Fix MMCHS0 dma properties"), however the conflict
resulting when only the one commit is reverted is trivial to resolve,
which leads to working MMC controllers again.
