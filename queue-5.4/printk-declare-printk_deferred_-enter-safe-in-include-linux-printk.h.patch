commit 85e3e7fbbb720b9897fba9a99659e31cbd1c082e upstream.

[This patch implements subset of original commit 85e3e7fbbb72 ("printk:
remove NMI tracking") where commit 1007843a9190 ("mm/page_alloc: fix
potential deadlock on zonelist_update_seq seqlock") depends on, for
commit 3d36424b3b58 ("mm/page_alloc: fix race condition between
build_all_zonelists and page allocation") was backported to stable.]

All NMI contexts are handled the same as the safe context: store the
message and defer printing. There is no need to have special NMI
context tracking for this. Using in_nmi() is enough.

There are several parts of the kernel that are manually calling into
the printk NMI context tracking in order to cause general printk
deferred printing:

    arch/arm/kernel/smp.c
    arch/powerpc/kexec/crash.c
    kernel/trace/trace.c

For arm/kernel/smp.c and powerpc/kexec/crash.c, provide a new
function pair printk_deferred_enter/exit that explicitly achieves the
same objective.

For ftrace, remove the printk context manipulation completely. It was
added in commit 03fc7f9c99c1 ("printk/nmi: Prevent deadlock when
accessing the main log buffer in NMI"). The purpose was to enforce
storing messages directly into the ring buffer even in NMI context.
It really should have only modified the behavior in NMI context.
There is no need for a special behavior any longer. All messages are
always stored directly now. The console deferring is handled
transparently in vprintk().
