Subject: ALSA: hda: Re-add dropped snd_poewr_change_state() calls

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit c8f79808cd8eb5bc8d14de129bd6d586d3fce0aa upstream.

The card power state change via snd_power_change_state() at the system
suspend/resume seems dropped mistakenly during the PM code rewrite.
The card power state doesn't play much role nowadays but it's still
referred in a few places such as the HDMI codec driver.

This patch restores them, but in a more appropriate place now in the
prepare and complete callbacks.

Fixes: f5dac54d9d93 ("ALSA: hda: Separate runtime and system suspend")
