Subject: net: vlan: avoid leaks on register_vlan_dev() failures

From: Jakub Kicinski <kuba@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 55b7ab1178cbf41f979ff83236d3321ad35ed2ad ]

VLAN checks for NETREG_UNINITIALIZED to distinguish between
registration failure and unregistration in progress.

Since commit cb626bf566eb ("net-sysfs: Fix reference count leak")
registration failure may, however, result in NETREG_UNREGISTERED
as well as NETREG_UNINITIALIZED.

This fix is similer to cebb69754f37 ("rtnetlink: Fix
memory(net_device) leak when ->newlink fails")

Fixes: cb626bf566eb ("net-sysfs: Fix reference count leak")
