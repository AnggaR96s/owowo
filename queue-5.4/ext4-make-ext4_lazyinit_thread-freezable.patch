Subject: ext4: make ext4_lazyinit_thread freezable

From: Lalith Rajendran <lalithkraj@google.com>

commit 3b575495ab8dbb4dbe85b4ac7f991693c3668ff5 upstream.

ext4_lazyinit_thread is not set freezable. Hence when the thread calls
try_to_freeze it doesn't freeze during suspend and continues to send
requests to the storage during suspend, resulting in suspend failures.
