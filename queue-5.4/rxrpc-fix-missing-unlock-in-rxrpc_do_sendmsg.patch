Subject: rxrpc: Fix missing unlock in rxrpc_do_sendmsg()

From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 4feb2c44629e6f9b459b41a5a60491069d346a95 ]

One of the error paths in rxrpc_do_sendmsg() doesn't unlock the call mutex
before returning.  Fix it to do this.

Note that this still doesn't get rid of the checker warning:

   ../net/rxrpc/sendmsg.c:617:5: warning: context imbalance in 'rxrpc_do_sendmsg' - wrong count at exit

I think the interplay between the socket lock and the call's user_mutex may
be too complicated for checker to analyse, especially as
rxrpc_new_client_call_for_sendmsg(), which it calls, returns with the
call's user_mutex if successful but unconditionally drops the socket lock.

Fixes: e754eba685aa ("rxrpc: Provide a cmsg to specify the amount of Tx data for a call")
