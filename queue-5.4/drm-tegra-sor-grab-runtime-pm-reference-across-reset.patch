Subject: drm/tegra: sor: Grab runtime PM reference across reset

From: Thierry Reding <treding@nvidia.com>

commit ac097aecfef0bb289ca53d2fe0b73fc7e1612a05 upstream.

The SOR resets are exclusively shared with the SOR power domain. This
means that exclusive access can only be granted temporarily and in order
for that to work, a rigorous sequence must be observed. To ensure that a
single consumer gets exclusive access to a reset, each consumer must
implement a rigorous protocol using the reset_control_acquire() and
reset_control_release() functions.

However, these functions alone don't provide any guarantees at the
system level. Drivers need to ensure that the only a single consumer has
access to the reset at the same time. In order for the SOR to be able to
exclusively access its reset, it must therefore ensure that the SOR
power domain is not powered off by holding on to a runtime PM reference
to that power domain across the reset assert/deassert operation.

This used to work fine by accident, but was revealed when recently more
devices started to rely on the SOR power domain.
