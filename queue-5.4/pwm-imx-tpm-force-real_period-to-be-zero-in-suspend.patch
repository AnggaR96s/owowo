Subject: pwm: imx-tpm: force 'real_period' to be zero in suspend

[ Upstream commit 661dfb7f46298e53f6c3deaa772fa527aae86193 ]

During suspend, all the tpm registers will lose values.
So the 'real_period' value of struct 'imx_tpm_pwm_chip'
should be forced to be zero to force the period update
code can be executed after system resume back.
