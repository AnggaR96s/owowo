Subject: mmc: block: Do not lose cache flush during CQE error recovery

From: Adrian Hunter <adrian.hunter@intel.com>

commit 174925d340aac55296318e43fd96c0e1d196e105 upstream.

During CQE error recovery, error-free data commands get requeued if there
is any data left to transfer, but non-data commands are completed even
though they have not been processed.  Requeue them instead.

Note the only non-data command is cache flush, which would have resulted in
a cache flush being lost if it was queued at the time of CQE recovery.
