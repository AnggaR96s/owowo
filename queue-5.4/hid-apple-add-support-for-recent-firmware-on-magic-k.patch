Subject: HID: apple: Add support for recent firmware on Magic Keyboards

From: Mansour Behabadi <mansour@oxplot.com>

[ Upstream commit e433be929e63265b7412478eb7ff271467aee2d7 ]

Magic Keyboards with more recent firmware (0x0100) report Fn key differently.
Without this patch, Fn key may not behave as expected and may not be
configurable via hid_apple fnmode module parameter.
