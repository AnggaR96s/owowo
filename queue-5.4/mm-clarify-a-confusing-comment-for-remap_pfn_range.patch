Subject: mm: clarify a confusing comment for remap_pfn_range()

From: WANG Wenhu <wenhu.wang@vivo.com>

commit 86a76331d94c4cfa72fe1831dbe4b492f66fdb81 upstream.

It really made me scratch my head.  Replace the comment with an accurate
and consistent description.

The parameter pfn actually refers to the page frame number which is
right-shifted by PAGE_SHIFT from the physical address.
