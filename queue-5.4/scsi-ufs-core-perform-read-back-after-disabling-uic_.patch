Subject: scsi: ufs: core: Perform read back after disabling UIC_COMMAND_COMPL

From: Andrew Halaney <ahalaney@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 4bf3855497b60765ca03b983d064b25e99b97657 ]

Currently, the UIC_COMMAND_COMPL interrupt is disabled and a wmb() is used
to complete the register write before any following writes.

wmb() ensures the writes complete in that order, but completion doesn't
mean that it isn't stored in a buffer somewhere. The recommendation for
ensuring this bit has taken effect on the device is to perform a read back
to force it to make it all the way to the device. This is documented in
device-io.rst and a talk by Will Deacon on this can be seen over here:

    https://youtu.be/i6DayghhA8Q?si=MiyxB5cKJXSaoc01&t=1678

Let's do that to ensure the bit hits the device. Because the wmb()'s
purpose wasn't to add extra ordering (on top of the ordering guaranteed by
writel()/readl()), it can safely be removed.
