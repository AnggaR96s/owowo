Subject: ASoC: codec2codec: avoid invalid/double-free of pcm runtime

From: Samuel Holland <samuel@sholland.org>

commit b6570fdb96edf45bcf71884bd2644bd73d348d1a upstream.

The PCM runtime was freed during PMU in the case that the event hook
encountered an error. However, it is also unconditionally freed during
PMD. Avoid a double-free by dropping the call to kfree in the PMU hook.
