Subject: random: wire up fops->splice_{read,write}_iter()

From: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>

commit 79025e727a846be6fd215ae9cdb654368ac3f9a6 upstream.

Now that random/urandom is using {read,write}_iter, we can wire it up to
using the generic splice handlers.

Fixes: 36e2c7421f02 ("fs: don't allow splice read/write without explicit ops")
Signed-off-by: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>
[Jason: added the splice_write path. Note that sendfile() and such still
 does not work for read, though it does for write, because of a file
 type restriction in splice_direct_to_actor(), which I'll address
 separately.]
