Subject: random: avoid warnings for !CONFIG_NUMA builds

From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

commit ab9a7e27044b87ff2be47b8f8e095400e7fccc44 upstream.

As crng_initialize_secondary() is only called by do_numa_crng_init(),
and the latter is under ifdeffery for CONFIG_NUMA, when CONFIG_NUMA is
not selected the compiler will warn that the former is unused:

| drivers/char/random.c:820:13: warning: 'crng_initialize_secondary' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
|   820 | static void crng_initialize_secondary(struct crng_state *crng)
|       |             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stephen reports that this happens for x86_64 noallconfig builds.

We could move crng_initialize_secondary() and crng_init_try_arch() under
the CONFIG_NUMA ifdeffery, but this has the unfortunate property of
separating them from crng_initialize_primary() and
crng_init_try_arch_early() respectively. Instead, let's mark
crng_initialize_secondary() as __maybe_unused.
