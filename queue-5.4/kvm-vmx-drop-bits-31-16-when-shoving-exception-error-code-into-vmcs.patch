Subject: KVM: VMX: Drop bits 31:16 when shoving exception error code into VMCS

From: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>

commit eba9799b5a6efe2993cf92529608e4aa8163d73b upstream.

Deliberately truncate the exception error code when shoving it into the
VMCS (VM-Entry field for vmcs01 and vmcs02, VM-Exit field for vmcs12).
Intel CPUs are incapable of handling 32-bit error codes and will never
generate an error code with bits 31:16, but userspace can provide an
arbitrary error code via KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS.  Failure to drop the bits
on exception injection results in failed VM-Entry, as VMX disallows
setting bits 31:16.  Setting the bits on VM-Exit would at best confuse
L1, and at worse induce a nested VM-Entry failure, e.g. if L1 decided to
reinject the exception back into L2.
