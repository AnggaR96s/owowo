Subject: binder: Remove bogus warning on failed same-process transaction

From: Jann Horn <jannh@google.com>

[ Upstream commit e8b8ae7ce32e17a5c29f0289e9e2a39c7dcaa1b8 ]

While binder transactions with the same binder_proc as sender and recipient
are forbidden, transactions with the same task_struct as sender and
recipient are possible (even though currently there is a weird check in
binder_transaction() that rejects them in the target==0 case).
Therefore, task_struct identities can't be used to distinguish whether
the caller is running in the context of the sender or the recipient.

Since I see no easy way to make this WARN_ON() useful and correct, let's
just remove it.

Fixes: 44d8047f1d87 ("binder: use standard functions to allocate fds")
