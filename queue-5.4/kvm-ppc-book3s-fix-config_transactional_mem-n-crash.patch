Subject: KVM: PPC: Book3S: Fix CONFIG_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n crash

From: Nicholas Piggin <npiggin@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit bd31ecf44b8e18ccb1e5f6b50f85de6922a60de3 ]

When running CPU_FTR_P9_TM_HV_ASSIST, HFSCR[TM] is set for the guest
even if the host has CONFIG_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n, which causes it to be
unprepared to handle guest exits while transactional.

Normal guests don't have a problem because the HTM capability will not
be advertised, but a rogue or buggy one could crash the host.

Fixes: 4bb3c7a0208f ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Work around transactional memory bugs in POWER9")
