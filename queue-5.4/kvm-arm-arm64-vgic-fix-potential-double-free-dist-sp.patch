Subject: KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Fix potential double free dist->spis in
 __kvm_vgic_destroy()

From: Miaohe Lin <linmiaohe@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit 0bda9498dd45280e334bfe88b815ebf519602cc3 ]

In kvm_vgic_dist_init() called from kvm_vgic_map_resources(), if
dist->vgic_model is invalid, dist->spis will be freed without set
dist->spis = NULL. And in vgicv2 resources clean up path,
__kvm_vgic_destroy() will be called to free allocated resources.
And dist->spis will be freed again in clean up chain because we
forget to set dist->spis = NULL in kvm_vgic_dist_init() failed
path. So double free would happen.
