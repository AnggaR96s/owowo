Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998-mtp: Add alias for blsp1_uart3

From: Bjorn Andersson <bjorn.andersson@linaro.org>

commit c9ec155b5962233aff3df65210bd6a4788dee21c upstream.

The msm_serial driver has a predefined set of uart ports defined, which
is allocated either by reading aliases or if no match is found a simple
counter, starting at index 0. But there's no logic in place to prevent
these two allocation mechanism from colliding. As a result either none
or all of the active msm_serial instances must be listed as aliases.

Define blsp1_uart3 as "serial1" to mitigate this problem.
