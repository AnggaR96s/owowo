Subject: ASoC: fix regwmask

From: 이경택 <gt82.lee@samsung.com>

commit 0ab070917afdc93670c2d0ea02ab6defb6246a7c upstream.

If regwshift is 32 and the selected architecture compiles '<<' operator
for signed int literal into rotating shift, '1<<regwshift' became 1 and
it makes regwmask to 0x0.
The literal is set to unsigned long to get intended regwmask.
