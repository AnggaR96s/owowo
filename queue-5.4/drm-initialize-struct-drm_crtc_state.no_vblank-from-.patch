Subject: drm: Initialize struct drm_crtc_state.no_vblank from device settings

From: Thomas Zimmermann <tzimmermann@suse.de>

[ Upstream commit 7beb691f1e6f349c9df3384a85e7a53c5601aaaf ]

At the end of a commit, atomic helpers can generate a fake VBLANK event
automatically. Originally implemented for writeback connectors, the
functionality can be used by any driver and/or hardware without proper
VBLANK interrupt.

The patch updates the documentation to make this behaviour official:
settings struct drm_crtc_state.no_vblank to true enables automatic
generation of fake VBLANK events.

The new interface drm_dev_has_vblank() returns true if vblanking has
been initialized for a device, or false otherwise. Atomic helpers use
this function when initializing no_vblank in the CRTC state in
drm_atomic_helper_check_modeset(). If vblanking has been initialized
for a device, no_blank is disabled. Otherwise it's enabled. Hence,
atomic helpers will automatically send out fake VBLANK events with any
driver that did not initialize vblanking.

v5:
	* more precise documentation and commit message
v4:
	* replace drm_crtc_has_vblank() with drm_dev_has_vblank()
	* add drm_dev_has_vblank() in this patch
	* move driver changes into separate patches
v3:
	* squash all related changes patches into this patch
