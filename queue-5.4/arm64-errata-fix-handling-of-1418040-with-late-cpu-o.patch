Subject: arm64: errata: Fix handling of 1418040 with late CPU onlining

From: Will Deacon <will@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit f969f03888b9438fdb227b6460d99ede5737326d ]

In a surprising turn of events, it transpires that CPU capabilities
configured as ARM64_CPUCAP_WEAK_LOCAL_CPU_FEATURE are never set as the
result of late-onlining. Therefore our handling of erratum 1418040 does
not get activated if it is not required by any of the boot CPUs, even
though we allow late-onlining of an affected CPU.

In order to get things working again, replace the cpus_have_const_cap()
invocation with an explicit check for the current CPU using
this_cpu_has_cap().
