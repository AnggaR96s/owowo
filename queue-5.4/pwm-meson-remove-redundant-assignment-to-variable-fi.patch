Subject: pwm: meson: Remove redundant assignment to variable fin_freq

[ Upstream commit 437fb760d046340d0dee3b4307e1cf4578fd8ca8 ]

The variable fin_freq is being initialized with a value that is never
read and it is being updated later with a new value. The initialization
is redundant and can be removed.
