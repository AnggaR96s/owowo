Subject: ALSA: pcm: Fix missing check of the new non-cached buffer type

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

[ Upstream commit 6111fd2370eecae9f11bfdc08ba097e0b51fcfd3 ]

The check for the mmap support via hw_support_mmap() function misses
the case where the device is with SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV_UC, which should
have been treated equally as SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV.  Let's fix it.

Note that this bug doesn't hit any practical problem, because
SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV_UC is used only for x86-specific drivers
(snd-hda-intel and snd-intel8x0) for the specific platforms that need
the non-cached buffers.  And, on such platforms, hw_support_mmap()
already returns true in anyway.  That's the reason I didn't put
Cc-to-stable mark here.  This is only for any theoretical future
extension.

Fixes: 425da159707b ("ALSA: pcm: use dma_can_mmap() to check if a device supports dma_mmap_*")
Fixes: 42e748a0b325 ("ALSA: memalloc: Add non-cached buffer type")
