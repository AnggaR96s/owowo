Subject: Revert "io_uring: only allow submit from owning task"

From: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>

commit 73e08e711d9c1d79fae01daed4b0e1fee5f8a275 upstream.

This ends up being too restrictive for tasks that willingly fork and
share the ring between forks. Andres reports that this breaks his
postgresql work. Since we're close to 5.5 release, revert this change
for now.
