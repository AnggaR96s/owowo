Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: keep I2S1 disabled for GPIO function on ROCK Pi
 4 series

From: FUKAUMI Naoki <naoki@radxa.com>

[ Upstream commit 849c19d14940b87332d5d59c7fc581d73f2099fd ]

I2S1 pins are exposed on 40-pin header on Radxa ROCK Pi 4 series.
their default function is GPIO, so I2S1 need to be disabled.
