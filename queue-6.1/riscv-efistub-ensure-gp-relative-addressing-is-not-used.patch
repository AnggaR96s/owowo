Subject: riscv/efistub: Ensure GP-relative addressing is not used

From: Jan Kiszka <jan.kiszka@siemens.com>

commit afb2a4fb84555ef9e61061f6ea63ed7087b295d5 upstream.

The cflags for the RISC-V efistub were missing -mno-relax, thus were
under the risk that the compiler could use GP-relative addressing. That
happened for _edata with binutils-2.41 and kernel 6.1, causing the
relocation to fail due to an invalid kernel_size in handle_kernel_image.
It was not yet observed with newer versions, but that may just be luck.
