Subject: regulator: core: fix unbalanced of node refcount in
 regulator_dev_lookup()

From: Yang Yingliang <yangyingliang@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit f2b41b748c19962b82709d9f23c6b2b0ce9d2f91 ]

I got the the following report:

  OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2,
  of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry:
  attach overlay node /i2c/pmic@62/regulators/exten

In of_get_regulator(), the node is returned from of_parse_phandle()
with refcount incremented, after using it, of_node_put() need be called.

Fixes: 69511a452e6d ("regulator: map consumer regulator based on device tree")
