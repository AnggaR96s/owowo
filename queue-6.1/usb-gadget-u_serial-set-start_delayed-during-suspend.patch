Subject: usb: gadget: u_serial: Set start_delayed during suspend

From: Prashanth K <quic_prashk@quicinc.com>

commit 5a444bea37e2759549ef72bfe83d1c8712e76b3d upstream.

Upstream commit aba3a8d01d62 ("usb: gadget: u_serial: add suspend
resume callbacks") added started_delayed flag, so that new ports
which are opened after USB suspend can start IO while resuming.
But if the port was already opened, and gadget suspend kicks in
afterwards, start_delayed will never be set. This causes resume
to bail out before calling gs_start_io(). Fix this by setting
start_delayed during suspend.

Fixes: aba3a8d01d62 ("usb: gadget: u_serial: add suspend resume callbacks")
