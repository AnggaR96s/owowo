Subject: selftests: mptcp: simult flows: fix some subtest names

From: Matthieu Baerts (NGI0) <matttbe@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 4d8e0dde0403b5a86aa83e243f020711a9c3e31f ]

The selftest was correctly recording all the results, but the 'reverse
direction' part was missing in the name when needed.

It is important to have a unique (sub)test name in TAP, because some CI
environments drop tests with duplicated name.

Fixes: 675d99338e7a ("selftests: mptcp: simult flows: format subtests results in TAP")
