Subject: x86/head/64: Add missing __head annotation to startup_64_load_idt()
To: stable@vger.kernel.org
Message-ID: <20240419081105.3817596-44-ardb+git@google.com>

From: Hou Wenlong <houwenlong.hwl@antgroup.com>

[ Commit 7f6874eddd81cb2ed784642a7a4321671e158ffe upstream ]

This function is currently only used in the head code and is only called
from startup_64_setup_env(). Although it would be inlined by the
compiler, it would be better to mark it as __head too in case it doesn't.
