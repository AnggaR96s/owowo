Subject: irqchip/loongson-eiointc: Use correct struct type in
 eiointc_domain_alloc()

From: Bibo Mao <maobibo@loongson.cn>

[ Upstream commit f1c2765c6afcd1f71f76ed8c9bf94acedab4cecb ]

eiointc_domain_alloc() uses struct eiointc, which is not defined, for a
pointer. Older compilers treat that as a forward declaration and due to
assignment of a void pointer there is no warning emitted. As the variable
is then handed in as a void pointer argument to irq_domain_set_info() the
code is functional.

Use struct eiointc_priv instead.
