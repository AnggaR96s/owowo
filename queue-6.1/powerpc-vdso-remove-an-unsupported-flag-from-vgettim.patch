Subject: powerpc/vdso: Remove an unsupported flag from vgettimeofday-32.o with
 clang

From: Nathan Chancellor <nathan@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 05e05bfc92d196669a3d087fc34d3998b6ddb758 ]

When clang's -Qunused-arguments is dropped from KBUILD_CPPFLAGS, it
warns:

  clang-16: error: argument unused during compilation: '-fno-stack-clash-protection' [-Werror,-Wunused-command-line-argument]

This warning happens because vgettimeofday-32.c gets its base CFLAGS
from the main kernel, which may contain flags that are only supported on
a 64-bit target but not a 32-bit one, which is the case here.
-fstack-clash-protection and its negation are only suppported by the
64-bit powerpc target but that flag is included in an invocation for a
32-bit powerpc target, so clang points out that while the flag is one
that it recognizes, it is not actually used by this compiler job.

To eliminate the warning, remove -fno-stack-clash-protection from
vgettimeofday-32.c's CFLAGS when using clang, as has been done for other
flags previously.
