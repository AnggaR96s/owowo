Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp: Vote for CX in USB controllers

From: Bjorn Andersson <quic_bjorande@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit fe07640280cd29ac2997a617a1fb5487feef9387 ]

Running GCC_USB30_*_MASTER_CLK at 200MHz requires CX at nominal level,
not doing so results in occasional lockups. This was previously hidden
by the fact that the display stack incorrectly voted for CX (instead of
MMCX).
