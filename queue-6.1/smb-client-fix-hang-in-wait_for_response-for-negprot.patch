Subject: smb: client: fix hang in wait_for_response() for negproto

From: Paulo Alcantara <pc@manguebit.com>

[ Upstream commit 7ccc1465465d78e6411b7bd730d06e7435802b5c ]

Call cifs_reconnect() to wake up processes waiting on negotiate
protocol to handle the case where server abruptly shut down and had no
chance to properly close the socket.

Simple reproducer:

  ssh 192.168.2.100 pkill -STOP smbd
  mount.cifs //192.168.2.100/test /mnt -o ... [never returns]
