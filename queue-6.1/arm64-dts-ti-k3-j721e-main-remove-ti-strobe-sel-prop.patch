Subject: arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-main: Remove ti,strobe-sel property

From: Bhavya Kapoor <b-kapoor@ti.com>

[ Upstream commit 4f4b30a777d3e61603119297965343a37be36435 ]

According to latest errata of J721e [1], (i2024) 'MMCSD: Peripherals
Do Not Support HS400' which applies to MMCSD0 subsystem. Speed modes
supported has been already updated but missed dropping 'ti,strobe-sel'
property which is only required by HS400 speed mode.

Thus, drop 'ti,strobe-sel' property from kernel dtsi for J721e SoC.
