Subject: modpost: Don't let "driver"s reference .exit.*

From: "Uwe Kleine-König" <u.kleine-koenig@pengutronix.de>

commit f177cd0c15fcc7bdbb68d8d1a3166dead95314c8 upstream.

Drivers must not reference functions marked with __exit as these likely
are not available when the code is built-in.

There are few creative offenders uncovered for example in ARCH=amd64
allmodconfig builds. So only trigger the section mismatch warning for
W=1 builds.

The dual rule that drivers must not reference .init.* is implemented
since commit 0db252452378 ("modpost: don't allow *driver to reference
.init.*") which however missed that .exit.* should be handled in the
same way.

Thanks to Masahiro Yamada and Arnd Bergmann who gave valuable hints to
find this improvement.
