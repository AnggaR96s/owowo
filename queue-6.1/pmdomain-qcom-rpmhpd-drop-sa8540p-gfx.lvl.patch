Subject: pmdomain: qcom: rpmhpd: Drop SA8540P gfx.lvl

From: Bjorn Andersson <quic_bjorande@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit 883957bee580b723fd87d49ac73e0c84fc03a446 ]

On SA8295P and SA8540P gfx.lvl is not provdied by rpmh, but rather is
handled by an external regulator (max20411). Drop gfx.lvl from the list
of power-domains exposed on this platform.

Fixes: f68f1cb3437d ("soc: qcom: rpmhpd: add sc8280xp & sa8540p rpmh power-domains")
