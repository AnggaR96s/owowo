Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sm8450: disable SDHCI SDR104/SDR50 on all boards

From: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 9d561dc4e5cc31e757f91eb7bb709d2e2a8c9ce0 ]

SDHCI on SM8450 HDK also has problems with SDR104/SDR50:

  mmc0: card never left busy state
  mmc0: error -110 whilst initialising SD card

so I think it is safe to assume this issue affects all SM8450 boards.
Move the quirk disallowing these modes to the SoC DTSI, to spare people
working on other boards the misery of debugging this issue.
