Subject: smackfs: Use rcu_assign_pointer() to ensure safe assignment in
 smk_set_cipso

From: Jiawei Ye <jiawei.ye@foxmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 2749749afa071f8a0e405605de9da615e771a7ce ]

In the `smk_set_cipso` function, the `skp->smk_netlabel.attr.mls.cat`
field is directly assigned to a new value without using the appropriate
RCU pointer assignment functions. According to RCU usage rules, this is
illegal and can lead to unpredictable behavior, including data
inconsistencies and impossible-to-diagnose memory corruption issues.

This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed
by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.

To address this, the assignment is now done using rcu_assign_pointer(),
which ensures that the pointer assignment is done safely, with the
necessary memory barriers and synchronization. This change prevents
potential RCU dereference issues by ensuring that the `cat` field is
safely updated while still adhering to RCU's requirements.
