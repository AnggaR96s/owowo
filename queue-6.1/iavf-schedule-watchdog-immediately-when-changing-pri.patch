Subject: iavf: schedule watchdog immediately when changing primary MAC

From: Stefan Assmann <sassmann@kpanic.de>

[ Upstream commit e2b53ea5a7c1fb484277ad12cd075f502cf03b04 ]

iavf_replace_primary_mac() utilizes queue_work() to schedule the
watchdog task but that only ensures that the watchdog task is queued
to run. To make sure the watchdog is executed asap use
mod_delayed_work().

Without this patch it may take up to 2s until the watchdog task gets
executed, which may cause long delays when setting the MAC address.

Fixes: a3e839d539e0 ("iavf: Add usage of new virtchnl format to set default MAC")
