Subject: mmc: renesas_sdhi: better reset from HS400 mode

From: Wolfram Sang <wsa+renesas@sang-engineering.com>

[ Upstream commit 0da69dd2155019ed4c444ede0e79ce7a4a6af627 ]

Up to now, HS400 adjustment mode was only disabled on soft reset when a
calibration table was in use. It is safer, though, to disable it as soon
as the instance has an adjustment related quirk set, i.e. bad taps or a
calibration table.
