Subject: mount: Don't allow copying MNT_UNBINDABLE|MNT_LOCKED mounts

From: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>

commit df7342b240185d58d3d9665c0bbf0a0f5570ec29 upstream.

Jonathan Calmels from NVIDIA reported that he's able to bypass the
mount visibility security check in place in the Linux kernel by using
a combination of the unbindable property along with the private mount
propagation option to allow a unprivileged user to see a path which
was purposefully hidden by the root user.

Reproducer:
  # Hide a path to all users using a tmpfs
  root@castiana:~# mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /sys/devices/
  root@castiana:~#

  # As an unprivileged user, unshare user namespace and mount namespace
  stgraber@castiana:~$ unshare -U -m -r

  # Confirm the path is still not accessible
  root@castiana:~# ls /sys/devices/

  # Make /sys recursively unbindable and private
  root@castiana:~# mount --make-runbindable /sys
  root@castiana:~# mount --make-private /sys

  # Recursively bind-mount the rest of /sys over to /mnnt
  root@castiana:~# mount --rbind /sys/ /mnt

  # Access our hidden /sys/device as an unprivileged user
  root@castiana:~# ls /mnt/devices/
  breakpoint cpu cstate_core cstate_pkg i915 intel_pt isa kprobe
  LNXSYSTM:00 msr pci0000:00 platform pnp0 power software system
  tracepoint uncore_arb uncore_cbox_0 uncore_cbox_1 uprobe virtual

Solve this by teaching copy_tree to fail if a mount turns out to be
both unbindable and locked.
