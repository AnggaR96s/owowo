Subject: ASoC: rt5677: Fix initialization of rt5677_of_match.data

From: Matthias Kaehlcke <mka@chromium.org>

[ Upstream commit f861e3e28a3016a2064d9f600eaa92a530b732b4 ]

The driver expects to find the device id in rt5677_of_match.data, however
it is currently assigned to rt5677_of_match.type. Fix this.

The problem was found with the help of clang:
  sound/soc/codecs/rt5677.c:5010:36: warning: expression which evaluates to
  zero treated as a null pointer constant of type 'const void *'
  [-Wnon-literal-null-conversion]
    { .compatible = "realtek,rt5677", RT5677 },
                                      ^~~~~~
