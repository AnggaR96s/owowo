Subject: KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Fix possible spectre-v1 write in vgic_mmio_write_apr()

From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit 6b8b9a48545e08345b8ff77c9fd51b1aebdbefb3 ]

It's possible for userspace to control n. Sanitize n when using it as an
array index, to inhibit the potential spectre-v1 write gadget.

Note that while it appears that n must be bound to the interval [0,3]
due to the way it is extracted from addr, we cannot guarantee that
compiler transformations (and/or future refactoring) will ensure this is
the case, and given this is a slow path it's better to always perform
the masking.

Found by smatch.
