Subject: intel_th: Fix device removal logic

From: Alexander Shishkin <alexander.shishkin@linux.intel.com>

commit 8801922cd94c918e4dc3a108ecaa500c4d40583f upstream.

Commit a753bfcfdb1f ("intel_th: Make the switch allocate its subdevices")
brings in new subdevice addition/removal logic that's broken for "host
mode": the SWITCH device has no children to begin with, which is not
handled in the code. This results in a null dereference bug later down
the path.

This patch fixes the subdevice removal code to handle host mode correctly.
