Subject: Revert "rpmsg: core: add support to power domains for devices"

From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

This reverts commit e5d9ae0077a5cf336d298002959dc0c8dcfe7b89 which is
commit fe782affd0f440a4e60e2cc81b8f2eccb2923113 upstream

Rafael reports that this patch causes problems:
	> -rc2 looks good. There is a problem on dragonboard during boot that was
	> introduced in v4.14.71 that I didn't notice last week. We'll bisect it
	> and report back later this week. dragonboard on the other branches (4.9,
	> 4.18, mainline) looks fine.

	As Dan pointed out, during validation, we have bisected this issue on
	a dragonboard 410c (can't find root device) to the following commit
	for v4.14:

	[1ed3a9307230] rpmsg: core: add support to power domains for devices

	There is an on-going discussion on "[PATCH] rpmsg: core: add support
	to power domains for devices" about this patch having other
	dependencies and breaking something else on v4.14 as well.

so drop it.
