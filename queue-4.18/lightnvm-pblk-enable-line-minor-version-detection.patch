Subject: lightnvm: pblk: enable line minor version detection

From: "Matias Bjørling" <mb@lightnvm.io>

[ Upstream commit 99b8dad1b6e52721904220322a947f7b75056303 ]

When recovering a line, an extra check was added when debugging was
active, such that minor version where also checked. Unfortunately,
this used the ifdef NVM_DEBUG, which is not correct.

Instead use the proper DEBUG def, and now that it compiles, also fix
the variable.
