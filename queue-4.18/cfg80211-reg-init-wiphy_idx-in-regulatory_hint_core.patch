Subject: cfg80211: reg: Init wiphy_idx in regulatory_hint_core()

[ Upstream commit 24f33e64fcd0d50a4b1a8e5b41bd0257aa66b0e8 ]

Core regulatory hints didn't set wiphy_idx to WIPHY_IDX_INVALID. Since
the regulatory request is zeroed, wiphy_idx was always implicitly set to
0. This resulted in updating only phy #0.
Fix that.

Fixes: 806a9e39670b ("cfg80211: make regulatory_request use wiphy_idx instead of wiphy")
