Subject: KVM: PPC: Book3S HV P9: Clear vcpu cpu fields before enabling host
 irqs

From: Nicholas Piggin <npiggin@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit bc91c04bfff7cdf676011b97bb21b2861d7b21c9 ]

On guest entry, vcpu->cpu and vcpu->arch.thread_cpu are set after
disabling host irqs. On guest exit there is a window whre tick time
accounting briefly enables irqs before these fields are cleared.

Move them up to ensure they are cleared before host irqs are run.
This is possibly not a problem, but is more symmetric and makes the
fields less surprising.
