Subject: ARM: dts: imx6qdl-vicut1.dtsi: Fix node name backlight_led

From: David Jander <david@protonic.nl>

[ Upstream commit 83c75e1bc2b83b3f0c718833bde677ebfa736283 ]

This naming error slipped through, so now that a new backlight node has
been added with correct spelling, fix this one also.

Fixes: 98efa526a0c4 ("ARM: dts: imx6qdl-vicut1/vicutgo: Add backlight_led node")
