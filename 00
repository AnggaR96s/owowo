Subject: [00/@num@] -stable review

This is the start of the stable review cycle for the 2.6.11.@rel@ release.  There
are @num@ patches in this series, all will be posted as a response to this one.
If anyone has any issues with these being applied, please let us know.  If
anyone is a maintainer of the proper subsystem, and wants to add a
signed-off-by: line to the patch, please respond with it.

These patches are sent out with a number of different people on the Cc: line.
If you wish to be a reviewer, please email stable@kernel.org to add your name to
