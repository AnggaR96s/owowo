Subject: RISC-V: Don't check text_mutex during stop_machine

From: Conor Dooley <conor.dooley@microchip.com>

[ Upstream commit 2a8db5ec4a28a0fce822d10224db9471a44b6925 ]

We're currently using stop_machine() to update ftrace & kprobes, which
means that the thread that takes text_mutex during may not be the same
as the thread that eventually patches the code.  This isn't actually a
race because the lock is still held (preventing any other concurrent
accesses) and there is only one thread running during stop_machine(),
but it does trigger a lockdep failure.

This patch just elides the lockdep check during stop_machine.

Fixes: c15ac4fd60d5 ("riscv/ftrace: Add dynamic function tracer support")
