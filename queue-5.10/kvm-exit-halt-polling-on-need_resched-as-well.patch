Subject: kvm: exit halt polling on need_resched() as well

From: Benjamin Segall <bsegall@google.com>

commit 262de4102c7bb8e59f26a967a8ffe8cce85cc537 upstream.

single_task_running() is usually more general than need_resched()
but CFS_BANDWIDTH throttling will use resched_task() when there
is just one task to get the task to block. This was causing
long-need_resched warnings and was likely allowing VMs to
overrun their quota when halt polling.
