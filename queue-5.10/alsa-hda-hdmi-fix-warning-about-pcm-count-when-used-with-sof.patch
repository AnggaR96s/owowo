Subject: ALSA: hda/hdmi: fix warning about PCM count when used with SOF

From: Kai Vehmanen <kai.vehmanen@linux.intel.com>

commit c74193787b2f683751a67603fb5f15c7584f355f upstream.

With commit 13046370c4d1 ("ALSA: hda/hdmi: let new platforms assign the
pcm slot dynamically"), old behaviour to consider the HDA pin number,
when choosing PCM to assign, was dropped.

Build on this change and limit the number of PCMs created to number of
converters (= maximum number of concurrent display/receivers) when
"mst_no_extra_pcms" and "dyn_pcm_no_legacy" quirks are both set.

Fix the check in hdmi_find_pcm_slot() to ensure only spec->pcm_used
entries are considered in the search. Elsewhere in the driver
spec->pcm_used is already checked properly.

Doing this avoids following warning at SOF driver probe for multiple
machine drivers:

[  112.425297] sof_sdw sof_sdw: hda_dsp_hdmi_build_controls: no
PCM in topology for HDMI converter 4
[  112.425298] sof_sdw sof_sdw: hda_dsp_hdmi_build_controls: no
PCM in topology for HDMI converter 5
[  112.425299] sof_sdw sof_sdw: hda_dsp_hdmi_build_controls: no
PCM in topology for HDMI converter 6
