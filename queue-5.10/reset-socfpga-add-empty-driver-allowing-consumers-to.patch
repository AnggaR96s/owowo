Subject: reset: socfpga: add empty driver allowing consumers to probe
MIME-Version: 1.0

[ Upstream commit 3ad60b4b3570937f3278509fe6797a5093ce53f8 ]

The early reset driver doesn't ever probe, which causes consuming
devices to be unable to probe. Add an empty driver to set this device
as available, allowing consumers to probe.
