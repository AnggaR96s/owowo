Subject: serial: 8250_exar: Set missing rs485_supported flag

[ Upstream commit 0c2a5f471ce58bca8f8ab5fcb911aff91eaaa5eb ]

The UART supports an auto-RTS mode in which the RTS pin is automatically
activated during transmission. So mark this mode as being supported even
if RTS is not controlled by the driver but the UART.

Also the serial core expects now at least one of both modes rts-on-send or
rts-after-send to be supported. This is since during sanitization
unsupported flags are deleted from a RS485 configuration set by userspace.
However if the configuration ends up with both flags unset, the core prints
a warning since it considers such a configuration invalid (see
uart_sanitize_serial_rs485()).
