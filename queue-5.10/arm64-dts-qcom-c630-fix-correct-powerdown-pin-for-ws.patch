Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: c630: fix correct powerdown pin for WSA881x

From: Srinivas Kandagatla <srinivas.kandagatla@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 9a253bb42f190efd1a1c156939ad7298b3529dca ]

WSA881x powerdown pin is connected to GPIO1, GPIO2 not GPIO2 and GPIO3,
so correct this. This was working so far due to a shift bug in gpio driver,
however once that is fixed this will stop working, so fix this!

For some reason we forgot to add this dts change in last merge cycle so
currently audio is broken in 5.13 as the gpio driver fix already landed
in 5.13.
