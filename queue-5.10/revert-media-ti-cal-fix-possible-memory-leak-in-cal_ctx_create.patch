This reverts commit c7a218cbf67fffcd99b76ae3b5e9c2e8bef17c8c.

The memory of ctx is allocated by devm_kzalloc in cal_ctx_create,
it should not be freed by kfree when cal_ctx_v4l2_init() fails,
otherwise kfree() will cause double free, so revert this patch.

The memory of ctx is allocated by kzalloc since commit
9e67f24e4d9 ("media: ti-vpe: cal: fix ctx uninitialization"),
so the fixes tag of patch c7a218cbf67fis not entirely accurate,
mainline should merge this patch, but it should not be merged
into 5.10, so we just revert this patch for this branch.
