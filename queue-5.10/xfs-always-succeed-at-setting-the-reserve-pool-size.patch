From: "Darrick J. Wong" <djwong@kernel.org>

commit 0baa2657dc4d79202148be79a3dc36c35f425060 upstream.

Nowadays, xfs_mod_fdblocks will always choose to fill the reserve pool
with freed blocks before adding to fdblocks.  Therefore, we can change
the behavior of xfs_reserve_blocks slightly -- setting the target size
of the pool should always succeed, since a deficiency will eventually
be made up as blocks get freed.
