Subject: Revert "serial: max310x: pass return value of spi_register_driver"

From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

[ Upstream commit b0a85abbe92e1a6f3e8580a4590fa7245de7090b ]

This reverts commit 51f689cc11333944c7a457f25ec75fcb41e99410.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

This change did not properly unwind from the error condition, so it was
not correct.
