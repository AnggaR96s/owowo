Subject: media: uvcvideo: Fix the bandwdith quirk on USB 3.x

From: Michal Pecio <michal.pecio@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 9e3d55fbd160b3ca376599a68b4cddfdc67d4153 ]

The bandwidth fixup quirk doesn't know that SuperSpeed exists and has
the same 8 service intervals per millisecond as High Speed, hence its
calculations are wrong.

Assume that all speeds from HS up use 8 intervals per millisecond.

No further changes are needed, updated code has been confirmed to work
with all speeds from FS to SS.
