Subject: devcoredump : Serialize devcd_del work

From: Mukesh Ojha <quic_mojha@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit 01daccf748323dfc61112f474cf2ba81015446b0 ]

In following scenario(diagram), when one thread X running dev_coredumpm()
adds devcd device to the framework which sends uevent notification to
userspace and another thread Y reads this uevent and call to
devcd_data_write() which eventually try to delete the queued timer that
is not initialized/queued yet.

So, debug object reports some warning and in the meantime, timer is
initialized and queued from X path. and from Y path, it gets reinitialized
again and timer->entry.pprev=NULL and try_to_grab_pending() stucks.

To fix this, introduce mutex and a boolean flag to serialize the behaviour.

 	cpu0(X)			                cpu1(Y)

    dev_coredump() uevent sent to user space
    device_add()  ======================> user space process Y reads the
                                          uevents writes to devcd fd
                                          which results into writes to
