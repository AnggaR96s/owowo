Subject: crypto: blake2s - add comment for blake2s_state fields

From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

commit 7d87131fadd53a0401b5c078dd64e58c3ea6994c upstream.

The first three fields of 'struct blake2s_state' are used in assembly
code, which isn't immediately obvious, so add a comment to this effect.
