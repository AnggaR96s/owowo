Subject: nfsd4: simplify process_lookup1

From: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 33311873adb0d55c287b164117b5b4bb7b1bdc40 ]

This STALE_CLIENTID check is redundant with the one in
lookup_clientid().

There's a difference in behavior is in case of memory allocation
failure, which I think isn't a big deal.
