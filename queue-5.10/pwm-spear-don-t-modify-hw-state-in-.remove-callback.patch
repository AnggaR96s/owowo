Subject: pwm: spear: Don't modify HW state in .remove callback

[ Upstream commit b601a18f12383001e7a8da238de7ca1559ebc450 ]

A consumer is expected to disable a PWM before calling pwm_put(). And if
they didn't there is hopefully a good reason (or the consumer needs
fixing). Also if disabling an enabled PWM was the right thing to do,
this should better be done in the framework instead of in each low level
driver.

So drop the hardware modification from the .remove() callback.
