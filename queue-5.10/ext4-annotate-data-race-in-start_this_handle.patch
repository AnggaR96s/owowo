Subject: ext4: annotate data race in start_this_handle()

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

commit 3b1833e92baba135923af4a07e73fe6e54be5a2f upstream.

Access to journal->j_running_transaction is not protected by appropriate
lock and thus is racy. We are well aware of that and the code handles
the race properly. Just add a comment and data_race() annotation.
