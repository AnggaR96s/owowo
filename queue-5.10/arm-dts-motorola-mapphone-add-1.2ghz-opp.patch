Subject: ARM: dts: motorola-mapphone: Add 1.2GHz OPP

From: Carl Philipp Klemm <philipp@uvos.xyz>

[ Upstream commit 19e367147ea8864dff1fb153cfab6d8e8da10324 ]

The omap4430 HS HIGH performance devces support 1.2GHz opp, lower speed
variants do not. However for mapphone devices Motorola seems to have
decided that this does not really matter for the SoC variants they have
tested to use, and decided to clock all devices, including the ones with
STANDARD performance chips at 1.2GHz upon release of the 3.0.8 vendor
kernel shiped with Android 4.0. Therefore it seems safe to do the same,
but let's only do it for Motorola devices as the others have not been
tested.

Note that we prevent overheating with the passive cooling device
cpu_alert0 configured in the dts file that starts lowering the speed as
needed.

This also removes the "failed to find current OPP for freq 1200000000"
warning.
