Subject: Revert "dts: phy: add GPIO number and active state used for phy reset"

From: Palmer Dabbelt <palmerdabbelt@google.com>

commit 3da3cc1b5f47115b16b5ffeeb4bf09ec331b0164 upstream.

VSC8541 phys need a special reset sequence, which the driver doesn't
currentlny support.  As a result enabling the reset via GPIO essentially
guarnteees that the device won't work correctly.  We've been relying on
bootloaders to reset the device for years, with this revert we'll go
back to doing so until we can sort out how to get the reset sequence
into the kernel.

This reverts commit a0fa9d727043da2238432471e85de0bdb8a8df65.
