Subject: nvmem: core: Fix a conflict between MTD and NVMEM on wp-gpios
 property

From: Christophe Kerello <christophe.kerello@foss.st.com>

[ Upstream commit f6c052afe6f802d87c74153b7a57c43b2e9faf07 ]

Wp-gpios property can be used on NVMEM nodes and the same property can
be also used on MTD NAND nodes. In case of the wp-gpios property is
defined at NAND level node, the GPIO management is done at NAND driver
level. Write protect is disabled when the driver is probed or resumed
and is enabled when the driver is released or suspended.

When no partitions are defined in the NAND DT node, then the NAND DT node
will be passed to NVMEM framework. If wp-gpios property is defined in
this node, the GPIO resource is taken twice and the NAND controller
driver fails to probe.

It would be possible to set config->wp_gpio at MTD level before calling
nvmem_register function but NVMEM framework will toggle this GPIO on
each write when this GPIO should only be controlled at NAND level driver
to ensure that the Write Protect has not been enabled.

A way to fix this conflict is to add a new boolean flag in nvmem_config
named ignore_wp. In case ignore_wp is set, the GPIO resource will
be managed by the provider.
