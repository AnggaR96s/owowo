commit 3f4b815a439adfb8f238335612c4b28bc10084d8

Currently, we return -EIO when we fail to migrate the page.

Migrations' failures are rather transient as they can happen due to
several reasons, e.g: high page refcount bump, mapping->migrate_page
failing etc.  All meaning that at that time the page could not be
migrated, but that has nothing to do with an EIO error.

Let us return -EBUSY instead, as we do in case we failed to isolate the
page.

While are it, let us remove the "ret" print as its value does not change.
