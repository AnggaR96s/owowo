Subject: riscv: process: fix kernel info leakage

From: Jisheng Zhang <jszhang@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 6510c78490c490a6636e48b61eeaa6fb65981f4b ]

thread_struct's s[12] may contain random kernel memory content, which
may be finally leaked to userspace. This is a security hole. Fix it
by clearing the s[12] array in thread_struct when fork.

As for kthread case, it's better to clear the s[12] array as well.

Fixes: 7db91e57a0ac ("RISC-V: Task implementation")
