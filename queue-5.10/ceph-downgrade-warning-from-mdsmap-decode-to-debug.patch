Subject: ceph: downgrade warning from mdsmap decode to debug

From: Luis Henriques <lhenriques@suse.de>

commit ccd1acdf1c49b835504b235461fd24e2ed826764 upstream.

While the MDS cluster is unstable and changing state the client may get
mdsmap updates that will trigger warnings:

  [144692.478400] ceph: mdsmap_decode got incorrect state(up:standby-replay)
  [144697.489552] ceph: mdsmap_decode got incorrect state(up:standby-replay)
  [144697.489580] ceph: mdsmap_decode got incorrect state(up:standby-replay)

This patch downgrades these warnings to debug, as they may flood the logs
if the cluster is unstable for a while.
