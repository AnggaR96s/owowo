Subject: software node: Provide replacement for device_add_properties()

From: Heikki Krogerus <heikki.krogerus@linux.intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 151f6ff78cdf1d6de76e90556cfc43f1e48abe18 ]

At the moment the function device_del() is calling
device_remove_properties() unconditionally. That will result into the
reference count of the software node attached to the device being
decremented, and in most cases it will hit 0 at that point. So in
practice device_del() will unregister the software node attached to
the device, even if that was not the intention of the caller. Right
now software nodes can not be reused or shared because of that.

So device_del() can not unregister the software nodes unconditionally
like that. Unfortunately some of the users of device_add_properties()
are now relying on this behaviour. Because of that, and also in
general, we do need a function that can offer similar behaviour where
the lifetime of the software node is bound to the lifetime of the
device. But it just has to be a separate function so the behaviour is
optional. We can not remove the device_remove_properties() call from
device_del() before we have that new function, and before we have
replaced device_add_properties() calls with it in all the places that
require that behaviour.

This adds function device_create_managed_software_node() that can be
used for exactly that purpose. Software nodes created with it are
declared "managed", and separate handling for those nodes is added to
the software node code. The reference count of the "managed" nodes is
decremented when the device they are attached to is removed. This will
not affect the other nodes that are not declared "managed".

The function device_create_managed_software_node() has also one
additional feature that device_add_properties() does not have. It
allows the software nodes created with it to be part of a node
hierarchy by taking also an optional parent node as parameter.
