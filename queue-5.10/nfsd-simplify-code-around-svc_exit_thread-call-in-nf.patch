Subject: nfsd: Simplify code around svc_exit_thread() call in nfsd()

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>

[ Upstream commit 18e4cf915543257eae2925671934937163f5639b ]

Previously a thread could exit asynchronously (due to a signal) so some
care was needed to hold nfsd_mutex over the last svc_put() call.  Now a
thread can only exit when svc_set_num_threads() is called, and this is
always called under nfsd_mutex.  So no care is needed.

Not only is the mutex held when a thread exits now, but the svc refcount
is elevated, so the svc_put() in svc_exit_thread() will never be a final
put, so the mutex isn't even needed at this point in the code.
