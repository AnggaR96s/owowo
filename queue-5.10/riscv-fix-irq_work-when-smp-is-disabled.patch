Subject: riscv: Fix irq_work when SMP is disabled

From: Samuel Holland <samuel@sholland.org>

commit 2273272823db6f67d57761df8116ae32e7f05bed upstream.

irq_work is triggered via an IPI, but the IPI infrastructure is not
included in uniprocessor kernels. As a result, irq_work never runs.
Fall back to the tick-based irq_work implementation on uniprocessor
configurations.
