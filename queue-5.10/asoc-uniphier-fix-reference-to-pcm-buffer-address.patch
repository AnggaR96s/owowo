Subject: ASoC: uniphier: Fix reference to PCM buffer address

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 827f3164aaa579eee6fd50c6654861d54f282a11 upstream.

Along with the transition to the managed PCM buffers, the driver now
accepts the dynamically allocated buffer, while it still kept the
reference to the old preallocated buffer address.  This patch corrects
to the right reference via runtime->dma_addr.

(Although this might have been already buggy before the cleanup with
the managed buffer, let's put Fixes tag to point that; it's a corner
case, after all.)
