Subject: mm: hwpoison: remove the unnecessary THP check

From: Yang Shi <shy828301@gmail.com>

commit c7cb42e94473aafe553c0f2a3d8ca904599399ed upstream.

When handling THP hwpoison checked if the THP is in allocation or free
stage since hwpoison may mistreat it as hugetlb page.  After commit
415c64c1453a ("mm/memory-failure: split thp earlier in memory error
handling") the problem has been fixed, so this check is no longer
needed.  Remove it.  The side effect of the removal is hwpoison may
report unsplit THP instead of unknown error for shmem THP.  It seems not
like a big deal.

The following patch "mm: filemap: check if THP has hwpoisoned subpage
for PMD page fault" depends on this, which fixes shmem THP with
hwpoisoned subpage(s) are mapped PMD wrongly.  So this patch needs to be
backported to -stable as well.
