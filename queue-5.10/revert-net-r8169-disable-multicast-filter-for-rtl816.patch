Subject: Revert "net: r8169: Disable multicast filter for RTL8168H and
 RTL8107E"

From: Heiner Kallweit <hkallweit1@gmail.com>

commit 6a26310273c323380da21eb23fcfd50e31140913 upstream.

This reverts commit efa5f1311c4998e9e6317c52bc5ee93b3a0f36df.

I couldn't reproduce the reported issue. What I did, based on a pcap
packet log provided by the reporter:
- Used same chip version (RTL8168h)
- Set MAC address to the one used on the reporters system
- Replayed the EAPOL unicast packet that, according to the reporter,
  was filtered out by the mc filter.
The packet was properly received.

Therefore the root cause of the reported issue seems to be somewhere
else. Disabling mc filtering completely for the most common chip
version is a quite big hammer. Therefore revert the change and wait
for further analysis results from the reporter.
