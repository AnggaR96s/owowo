Subject: remoteproc: q6v5-mss: Remove mem clk from the active pool

From: Sibi Sankar <sibis@codeaurora.org>

[ Upstream commit 6ba519aa13758dd55248f3a6f939536656df2661 ]

Currently the mem clk is voted upon from both the active and proxy pool on
MSM8998 SoCs where only a proxy vote should suffice. Fix this by removing
mem clk from the active pool.

Fixes: 1665cbd5731fa ("remoteproc: qcom_q6v5_mss: Add support for MSM8998")
