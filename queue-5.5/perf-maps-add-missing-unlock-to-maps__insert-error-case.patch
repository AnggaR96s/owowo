Subject: perf maps: Add missing unlock to maps__insert() error case

From: Cengiz Can <cengiz@kernel.wtf>

commit 85fc95d75970ee7dd8e01904e7fb1197c275ba6b upstream.

`tools/perf/util/map.c` has a function named `maps__insert` that
acquires a write lock if its in multithread context.

Even though this lock is released when function successfully completes,
there's a branch that is executed when `maps_by_name == NULL` that
returns from this function without releasing the write lock.

Added an `up_write` to release the lock when this happens.

Fixes: a7c2b572e217 ("perf map_groups: Auto sort maps by name, if needed")
