Subject: jbd2: clear JBD2_ABORT flag before journal_reset to update log tail
 info when load journal

From: Kai Li <li.kai4@h3c.com>

[ Upstream commit a09decff5c32060639a685581c380f51b14e1fc2 ]

If the journal is dirty when the filesystem is mounted, jbd2 will replay
the journal but the journal superblock will not be updated by
journal_reset() because JBD2_ABORT flag is still set (it was set in
journal_init_common()). This is problematic because when a new transaction
is then committed, it will be recorded in block 1 (journal->j_tail was set
to 1 in journal_reset()). If unclean shutdown happens again before the
journal superblock is updated, the new recorded transaction will not be
replayed during the next mount (because of stale sb->s_start and
sb->s_sequence values) which can lead to filesystem corruption.

Fixes: 85e0c4e89c1b ("jbd2: if the journal is aborted then don't allow update of the log tail")
