Subject: ARM: dts: rockchip: add reg property to brcmf sub node for
 rk3188-bqedison2qc

From: Johan Jonker <jbx6244@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit cf206bca178cd5b5a436494b2e0cea75295944f4 ]

An experimental test with the command below gives this error:
rk3188-bqedison2qc.dt.yaml: dwmmc@10218000: wifi@1:
'reg' is a required property

So fix this by adding a reg property to the brcmf sub node.
Also add #address-cells and #size-cells to prevent more warnings.

make ARCH=arm dtbs_check
