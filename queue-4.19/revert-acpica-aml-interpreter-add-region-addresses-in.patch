Subject: Revert "ACPICA: AML interpreter: add region addresses in global list during initialization"

From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

This reverts commit 22083c028d0b3ee419232d25ce90367e5b25df8f which is
commit 4abb951b73ff0a8a979113ef185651aa3c8da19b upstream.

	making it sound like it was fixing an actual bug. This is not the case.
	The commit fixes a side issue discovered while investigating bug
	#200011. It does NOT fix bug #200011 itself (as explicitly reported by
	Jean-Marc at https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200011#c65 ).

	It does however cause regressions, despite what the commit message says. See:

	https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201721

	and I expect more similar regressions, as ACPI resource conflicts are
	very frequent.

	This commit was not stable material to start with. It is intrusive,
	presents a risk of side effects, and does not solve an actual bug that
	is bothering users.
