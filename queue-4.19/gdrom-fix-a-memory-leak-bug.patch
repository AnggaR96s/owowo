Subject: gdrom: fix a memory leak bug

[ Upstream commit 093c48213ee37c3c3ff1cf5ac1aa2a9d8bc66017 ]

In probe_gdrom(), the buffer pointed by 'gd.cd_info' is allocated through
kzalloc() and is used to hold the information of the gdrom device. To
register and unregister the device, the pointer 'gd.cd_info' is passed to
the functions register_cdrom() and unregister_cdrom(), respectively.
However, this buffer is not freed after it is used, which can cause a
memory leak bug.

This patch simply frees the buffer 'gd.cd_info' in exit_gdrom() to fix the
above issue.
