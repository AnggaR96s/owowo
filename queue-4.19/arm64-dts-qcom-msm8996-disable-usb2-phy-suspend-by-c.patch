Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Disable USB2 PHY suspend by core

From: Manu Gautam <mgautam@codeaurora.org>

[ Upstream commit d026c96b25b7ce5df89526aad2df988d553edb4d ]

QUSB2 PHY on msm8996 doesn't work well when autosuspend by
dwc3 core using USB2PHYCFG register is enabled. One of the
issue seen is that PHY driver reports PLL lock failure and
fails phy_init() if dwc3 core has USB2 PHY suspend enabled.
Fix this by using quirks to disable USB2 PHY LPM/suspend and
dwc3 core already takes care of explicitly suspending PHY
during suspend if quirks are specified.
