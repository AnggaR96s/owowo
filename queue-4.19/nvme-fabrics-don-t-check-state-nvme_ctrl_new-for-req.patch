Subject: nvme-fabrics: don't check state NVME_CTRL_NEW for request acceptance

From: Sagi Grimberg <sagi@grimberg.me>

[ Upstream commit d7144f5c4cf4de95fdc3422943cf51c06aeaf7a7 ]

NVME_CTRL_NEW should never see any I/O, because in order to start
initialization it has to transition to NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING and from
there it will never return to this state.
