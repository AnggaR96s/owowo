Subject: ceph: fix double unlock in handle_cap_export()

From: Wu Bo <wubo40@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit 4d8e28ff3106b093d98bfd2eceb9b430c70a8758 ]

If the ceph_mdsc_open_export_target_session() return fails, it will
do a "goto retry", but the session mutex has already been unlocked.
Re-lock the mutex in that case to ensure that we don't unlock it
twice.
