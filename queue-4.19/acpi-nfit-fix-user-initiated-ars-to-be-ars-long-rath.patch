Subject: acpi/nfit: Fix user-initiated ARS to be "ARS-long" rather than
 "ARS-short"

[ Upstream commit b5fd2e00a60248902315fb32210550ac3cb9f44c ]

A "short" ARS (address range scrub) instructs the platform firmware to
return known errors. In contrast, a "long" ARS instructs platform
firmware to arrange every data address on the DIMM to be read / checked
for poisoned data.

The conversion of the flags in commit d3abaf43bab8 "acpi, nfit: Fix
Address Range Scrub completion tracking", changed the meaning of passing
'0' to acpi_nfit_ars_rescan(). Previously '0' meant "not short", now '0'
is ARS_REQ_SHORT. Pass ARS_REQ_LONG to restore the expected scrub-type
behavior of user-initiated ARS sessions.
