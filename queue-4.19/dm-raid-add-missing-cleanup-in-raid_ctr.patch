Subject: dm raid: add missing cleanup in raid_ctr()

From: Wenwen Wang <wenwen@cs.uga.edu>

commit dc1a3e8e0cc6b2293b48c044710e63395aeb4fb4 upstream.

If rs_prepare_reshape() fails, no cleanup is executed, leading to
leak of the raid_set structure allocated at the beginning of
raid_ctr(). To fix this issue, go to the label 'bad' if the error
occurs.
