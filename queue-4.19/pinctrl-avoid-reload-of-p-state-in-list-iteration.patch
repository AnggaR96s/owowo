Subject: pinctrl: avoid reload of p state in list iteration

From: Maria Yu <quic_aiquny@quicinc.com>

commit 4198a9b571065978632276264e01d71d68000ac5 upstream.

When in the list_for_each_entry iteration, reload of p->state->settings
with a local setting from old_state will turn the list iteration into an
infinite loop.

The typical symptom when the issue happens, will be a printk message like:

  "not freeing pin xx (xxx) as part of deactivating group xxx - it is
already used for some other setting".

This is a compiler-dependent problem, one instance occurred using Clang
version 10.0 on the arm64 architecture with linux version 4.19.
