Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: limit clock rate of MMC controllers for RK3328

From: Shawn Lin <shawn.lin@rock-chips.com>

commit 03e61929c0d227ed3e1c322fc3804216ea298b7e upstream.

150MHz is a fundamental limitation of RK3328 Soc, w/o this limitation,
eMMC, for instance, will run into 200MHz clock rate in HS200 mode, which
makes the RK3328 boards not always boot properly. By adding it in
rk3328.dtsi would also obviate the worry of missing it when adding new
boards.
