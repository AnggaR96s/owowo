Subject: iwlwifi: mvm: synchronize TID queue removal

From: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 06bc6f6ed4ae0246a5e52094d1be90906a1361c7 ]

When we mark a TID as no longer having a queue, there's no
guarantee the TX path isn't using this txq_id right now,
having accessed it just before we reset the value. To fix
this, add synchronize_net() when we change the TIDs from
having a queue to not having one, so that we can then be
sure that the TX path is no longer accessing that queue.
