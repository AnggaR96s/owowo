Subject: xfs: fix PAGE_MASK usage in xfs_free_file_space

commit a579121f94aba4e8bad1a121a0fad050d6925296 upstream.

In commit e53c4b598, I *tried* to teach xfs to force writeback when we
fzero/fpunch right up to EOF so that if EOF is in the middle of a page,
the post-EOF part of the page gets zeroed before we return to userspace.
Unfortunately, I missed the part where PAGE_MASK is ~(PAGE_SIZE - 1),
which means that we totally fail to zero if we're fpunching and EOF is
within the first page.  Worse yet, the same PAGE_MASK thinko plagues the
filemap_write_and_wait_range call, so we'd initiate writeback of the
entire file, which (mostly) masked the thinko.

Drop the tricky PAGE_MASK and replace it with correct usage of PAGE_SIZE
and the proper rounding macros.

Fixes: e53c4b598 ("xfs: ensure post-EOF zeroing happens after zeroing part of a file")
