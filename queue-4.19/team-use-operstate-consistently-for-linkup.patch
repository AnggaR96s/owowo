Subject: team: use operstate consistently for linkup

From: George Wilkie <gwilkie@vyatta.att-mail.com>

[ Upstream commit 8c7a77267eec81dd81af8412f29e50c0b1082548 ]

When a port is added to a team, its initial state is derived
from netif_carrier_ok rather than netif_oper_up.
If it is carrier up but operationally down at the time of being
added, the port state.linkup will be set prematurely.
port state.linkup should be set consistently using
netif_oper_up rather than netif_carrier_ok.
