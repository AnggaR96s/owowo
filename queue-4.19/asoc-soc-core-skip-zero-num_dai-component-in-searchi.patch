Subject: ASoC: soc-core: skip zero num_dai component in searching dai name

From: Shengjiu Wang <shengjiu.wang@nxp.com>

[ Upstream commit f7d344a2bd5ec81fbd1ce76928fd059e57ec9bea ]

In the case like dmaengine which's not a dai but as a component, the
num_dai is zero, dmaengine component has the same component_of_node
as cpu dai, when cpu dai component is not ready, but dmaengine component
is ready, try to get cpu dai name, the snd_soc_get_dai_name() return
-EINVAL, not -EPROBE_DEFER, that cause below error:

asoc-simple-card <card name>: parse error -22
asoc-simple-card: probe of <card name> failed with error -22

The sound card failed to probe.

So this patch fixes the issue above by skipping the zero num_dai
component in searching dai name.
