Subject: regulator: core: enable power when setting up constraints

From: Olliver Schinagl <oliver@schinagl.nl>

[ Upstream commit 2bb1666369339f69f227ad060c250afde94d5c69 ]

When a regulator is marked as always on, it is enabled early on, when
checking and setting up constraints. It makes the assumption that the
bootloader properly initialized the regulator, and just in case enables
the regulator anyway.

Some constraints however currently get missed, such as the soft-start
and ramp-delay. This causes the regulator to be enabled, without the
soft-start and ramp-delay being applied, which in turn can cause
high-currents or other start-up problems.

By moving the always-enabled constraints later in the constraints check,
we can at least ensure all constraints for the regulator are followed.
