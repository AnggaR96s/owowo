Subject: ARM: dts: imx6ul: fix lcdif node compatible

From: Alexander Stein <alexander.stein@ew.tq-group.com>

[ Upstream commit 1a884d17ca324531634cce82e9f64c0302bdf7de ]

In yaml binding "fsl,imx6ul-lcdif" is listed as compatible to imx6sx-lcdif,
but not imx28-lcdif. Change the list accordingly. Fixes the
dt_binding_check warning:
lcdif@21c8000: compatible: 'oneOf' conditional failed, one must be fixed:
['fsl,imx6ul-lcdif', 'fsl,imx28-lcdif'] is too long
Additional items are not allowed ('fsl,imx28-lcdif' was unexpected)
'fsl,imx6ul-lcdif' is not one of ['fsl,imx23-lcdif', 'fsl,imx28-lcdif',
'fsl,imx6sx-lcdif']
'fsl,imx6sx-lcdif' was expected
