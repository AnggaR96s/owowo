Subject: ARM: dts: bcm: HR2: Fixed QSPI compatible string

From: Florian Fainelli <f.fainelli@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit d663186293a818af97c648624bee6c7a59e8218b ]

The string was incorrectly defined before from least to most specific,
swap the compatible strings accordingly.

Fixes: b9099ec754b5 ("ARM: dts: Add Broadcom Hurricane 2 DTS include file")
