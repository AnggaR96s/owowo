Subject: ARM: dts: sun5i: a10s: Fix HDMI output DTC warning

From: Maxime Ripard <maxime.ripard@bootlin.com>

[ Upstream commit ed5fc60b909427be6ca93d3e07a0a5f296d7000a ]

Our HDMI output endpoint on the A10s DTSI has a warning under DTC: "graph
node has single child node 'endpoint', #address-cells/#size-cells are not
necessary". Fix this by removing those properties.
