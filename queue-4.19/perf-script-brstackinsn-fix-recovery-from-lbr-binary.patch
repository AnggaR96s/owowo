Subject: perf script brstackinsn: Fix recovery from LBR/binary mismatch

From: Andi Kleen <ak@linux.intel.com>

[ Upstream commit e98df280bc2a499fd41d7f9e2d6733884de69902 ]

When the LBR data and the instructions in a binary do not match the loop
printing instructions could get confused and print a long stream of
bogus <bad> instructions.

The problem was that if the instruction decoder cannot decode an
instruction it ilen wasn't initialized, so the loop going through the
basic block would continue with the previous value.

Harden the code to avoid such problems:

- Make sure ilen is always freshly initialized and is 0 for bad
  instructions.

- Do not overrun the code buffer while printing instructions

- Print a warning message if the final jump is not on an instruction
  boundary.
