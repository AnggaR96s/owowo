Subject: Documentation: security-bugs.rst: clarify CVE handling

From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

commit 3c1897ae4b6bc7cc586eda2feaa2cd68325ec29c upstream.

The kernel security team does NOT assign CVEs, so document that properly
and provide the "if you want one, ask MITRE for it" response that we
give on a weekly basis in the document, so we don't have to constantly
say it to everyone who asks.

 CVE assignment
 --------------
 
-The security team does not normally assign CVEs, nor do we require them
-for reports or fixes, as this can needlessly complicate the process and
-may delay the bug handling. If a reporter wishes to have a CVE identifier
-assigned ahead of public disclosure, they will need to contact the private
-linux-distros list, described above. When such a CVE identifier is known
-before a patch is provided, it is desirable to mention it in the commit
-message if the reporter agrees.
