Subject: audit: ensure userspace is penalized the same as the kernel when
 under pressure

From: Paul Moore <paul@paul-moore.com>

[ Upstream commit 8f110f530635af44fff1f4ee100ecef0bac62510 ]

Due to the audit control mutex necessary for serializing audit
userspace messages we haven't been able to block/penalize userspace
processes that attempt to send audit records while the system is
under audit pressure.  The result is that privileged userspace
applications have a priority boost with respect to audit as they are
not bound by the same audit queue throttling as the other tasks on
the system.

This patch attempts to restore some balance to the system when under
audit pressure by blocking these privileged userspace tasks after
they have finished their audit processing, and dropped the audit
control mutex, but before they return to userspace.
