Subject: ARM: dts: da850-lcdk: Correct the sound card name

[ Upstream commit c25748acc5c20786ecb7518bfeae8fcef93472d6 ]

To avoid  the following error:
asoc-simple-card sound: ASoC: Failed to create card debugfs directory

Which is because the card name contains '/' character, which can not be
used in file or directory names.
