Subject: ARM: dts: rockchip: Fix erroneous SPI bus dtc warnings on rk3036

From: Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 131c3eb428ccd5f0c784b9edb4f72ec296a045d2 ]

dtc has new checks for SPI buses. The rk3036 dts file has a node named
spi' which causes false positive warnings. As the node is a pinctrl child
node, change the node name to be 'spi-pins' to fix the warnings.

arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3036-evb.dtb: Warning (spi_bus_bridge): /pinctrl/spi: incorrect #address-cells for SPI bus
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3036-kylin.dtb: Warning (spi_bus_bridge): /pinctrl/spi: incorrect #address-cells for SPI bus
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3036-evb.dtb: Warning (spi_bus_bridge): /pinctrl/spi: incorrect #size-cells for SPI bus
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3036-kylin.dtb: Warning (spi_bus_bridge): /pinctrl/spi: incorrect #size-cells for SPI bus
