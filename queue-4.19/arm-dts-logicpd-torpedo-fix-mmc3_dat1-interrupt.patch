Subject: ARM: dts: LogicPD Torpedo: Fix mmc3_dat1 interrupt

[ Upstream commit 6809564d64ff1301d44c13334cc0e8369e825a20 ]

When the Torpedo was first introduced back at Kernel 4.2,
the interrupt extended flag has been set incorrectly.

It was subsequently moved, so this patch corrects Kernel
4.18+

Fixes: a38867305203 ("ARM: dts: Move move WiFi bindings to
logicpd-torpedo-37xx-devkit") # v4.18+
