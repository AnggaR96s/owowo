Subject: ALSA: hda/conexant: Partial revert of a quirk for Lenovo

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit b871cb971c683f7f212e7ca3c9a6709a75785116 upstream.

The recent commit f83bb2592482 ("ALSA: hda/conexant: Add quirk for
LENOVO 20149 Notebook model") introduced a quirk for the device with
17aa:3977, but this caused a regression on another model (Lenovo
Ideadpad U31) with the very same PCI SSID.  And, through skimming over
the net, it seems that this PCI SSID is used for multiple different
models, so it's no good idea to apply the quirk with the SSID.

Although we may take a different ID check (e.g. the codec SSID instead
of the PCI SSID), unfortunately, the original patch author couldn't
identify the hardware details any longer as the machine was returned,
and we can't develop the further proper fix.

In this patch, instead, we partially revert the change so that the
quirk won't be applied as default for addressing the regression.
Meanwhile, the quirk function itself is kept, and it's now made to be
applicable via the explicit model=lenovo-20149 option.
