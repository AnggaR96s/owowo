Subject: ARM: 8896/1: VDSO: Don't leak kernel addresses

From: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert@linux-m68k.org>

[ Upstream commit 3e07590e7248db951fed6a2039403b5a39010be7 ]

Since commit ad67b74d2469d9b8 ("printk: hash addresses printed with
%p"), an obfuscated kernel pointer is printed at every boot if
debugging is enabled:

    vdso: 1 text pages at base (____ptrval____)

Remove the print completely, as it's useless without the address.

Based on commit 0f1bf7e39822476b ("arm64/vdso: don't leak kernel
addresses").

Fixes: ad67b74d2469d9b8 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p")
