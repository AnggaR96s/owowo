Subject: ima: Handle -ESTALE returned by ima_filter_rule_match()

From: GUO Zihua <guozihua@huawei.com>

commit c7423dbdbc9ecef7fff5239d144cad4b9887f4de upstream.

IMA relies on the blocking LSM policy notifier callback to update the
LSM based IMA policy rules.

When SELinux update its policies, IMA would be notified and starts
updating all its lsm rules one-by-one. During this time, -ESTALE would
be returned by ima_filter_rule_match() if it is called with a LSM rule
that has not yet been updated. In ima_match_rules(), -ESTALE is not
handled, and the LSM rule is considered a match, causing extra files
to be measured by IMA.

Fix it by re-initializing a temporary rule if -ESTALE is returned by
ima_filter_rule_match(). The origin rule in the rule list would be
updated by the LSM policy notifier callback.

Fixes: b16942455193 ("ima: use the lsm policy update notifier")
