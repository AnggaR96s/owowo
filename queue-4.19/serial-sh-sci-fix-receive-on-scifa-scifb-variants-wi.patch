Subject: serial: sh-sci: Fix receive on SCIFA/SCIFB variants with DMA

[ Upstream commit 202dc3cc10b4d37e5251431acf8d5040a8876c7d ]

On SCIFA and SCIFB serial ports with DMA support (i.e. some ports on
R-Car Gen2 and RZ/G1 SoCs), receive DMA operations are submitted before
the DMA channel pointer is initialized.  Hence this fails, and the
driver tries to fall back to PIO.  However, at this early phase in the
initialization sequence, fallback to PIO does not work, leading to a
serial port that cannot receive any data.

Fix this by calling sci_submit_rx() after initialization of the DMA
channel pointer.
