Subject: ARM: dts: sun7i: Fix HDMI output DTC warning

From: Maxime Ripard <maxime.ripard@bootlin.com>

[ Upstream commit 4d9a06979b1ae0c802440cb4433dfcd85fc7bdd3 ]

Our HDMI output endpoint on the A10s DTSI has a warning under DTC: "graph
node has single child node 'endpoint', #address-cells/#size-cells are not
necessary". Fix this by removing those properties.
