Subject: selftests/kvm: make platform_info_test pass on AMD

[ Upstream commit e4427372398c31f57450565de277f861a4db5b3b ]

test_msr_platform_info_disabled() generates EXIT_SHUTDOWN but VMCB state
is undefined after that so an attempt to launch this guest again from
test_msr_platform_info_enabled() fails. Reorder the tests to make test
pass.
