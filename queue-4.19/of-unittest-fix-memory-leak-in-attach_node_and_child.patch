Subject: of: unittest: fix memory leak in attach_node_and_children

From: Erhard Furtner <erhard_f@mailbox.org>

[ Upstream commit 2aacace6dbbb6b6ce4e177e6c7ea901f389c0472 ]

In attach_node_and_children memory is allocated for full_name via
kasprintf. If the condition of the 1st if is not met the function
returns early without freeing the memory. Add a kfree() to fix that.

This has been detected with kmemleak:

It looks like the leak was introduced by this commit:
Fixes: 5babefb7f7ab ("of: unittest: allow base devicetree to have symbol metadata")
