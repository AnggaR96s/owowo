Subject: ARM: dts: rockchip: disable arm_global_timer on rk3066 and rk3188

From: Johan Jonker <jbx6244@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit da74858a475782a3f16470907814c8cc5950ad68 ]

The clock source and the sched_clock provided by the arm_global_timer
on Rockchip rk3066a/rk3188 are quite unstable because their rates
depend on the CPU frequency.

Recent changes to the arm_global_timer driver makes it impossible to use.

On the other side, the arm_global_timer has a higher rating than the
ROCKCHIP_TIMER, it will be selected by default by the time framework
while we want to use the stable Rockchip clock source.

Keep the arm_global_timer disabled in order to have the
DW_APB_TIMER (rk3066a) or ROCKCHIP_TIMER (rk3188) selected by default.
