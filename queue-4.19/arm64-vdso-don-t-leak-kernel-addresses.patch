Subject: arm64/vdso: don't leak kernel addresses

From: Matteo Croce <mcroce@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 0f1bf7e39822476b2f921435cf990f67a61f5f92 ]

Since commit ad67b74d2469d9b8 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p"),
two obfuscated kernel pointer are printed at every boot:

    vdso: 2 pages (1 code @ (____ptrval____), 1 data @ (____ptrval____))

Remove the the print completely, as it's useless without the addresses.

Fixes: ad67b74d2469d9b8 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p")
