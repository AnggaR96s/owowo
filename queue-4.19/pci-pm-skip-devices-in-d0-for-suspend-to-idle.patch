Subject: PCI: PM: Skip devices in D0 for suspend-to-idle

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 3e26c5feed2add218046ecf91bab3cfa9bf762a6 ]

Commit d491f2b75237 ("PCI: PM: Avoid possible suspend-to-idle issue")
attempted to avoid a problem with devices whose drivers want them to
stay in D0 over suspend-to-idle and resume, but it did not go as far
as it should with that.

Namely, first of all, the power state of a PCI bridge with a
downstream device in D0 must be D0 (based on the PCI PM spec r1.2,
sec 6, table 6-1, if the bridge is not in D0, there can be no PCI
transactions on its secondary bus), but that is not actively enforced
during system-wide PM transitions, so use the skip_bus_pm flag
introduced by commit d491f2b75237 for that.

Second, the configuration of devices left in D0 (whatever the reason)
during suspend-to-idle need not be changed and attempting to put them
into D0 again by force is pointless, so explicitly avoid doing that.
