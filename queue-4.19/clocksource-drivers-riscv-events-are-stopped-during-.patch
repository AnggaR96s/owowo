Subject: clocksource/drivers/riscv: Events are stopped during CPU suspend

From: Samuel Holland <samuel@sholland.org>

[ Upstream commit 232ccac1bd9b5bfe73895f527c08623e7fa0752d ]

Some implementations of the SBI time extension depend on hart-local
state (for example, CSRs) that are lost or hardware that is powered
down when a CPU is suspended. To be safe, the clockevents driver
cannot assume that timer IRQs will be received during CPU suspend.
