Subject: gfs2: Fix metadata read-ahead during truncate (2)

From: Andreas Gruenbacher <agruenba@redhat.com>

commit e7445ceddfc220c1aede6d42758a5acb8844e9c3 upstream.

The previous attempt to fix for metadata read-ahead during truncate was
incorrect: for files with a height > 2 (1006989312 bytes with a block
size of 4096 bytes), read-ahead requests were not being issued for some
of the indirect blocks discovered while walking the metadata tree,
leading to significant slow-downs when deleting large files.  Fix that.

In addition, only issue read-ahead requests in the first pass through
the meta-data tree, while deallocating data blocks.
