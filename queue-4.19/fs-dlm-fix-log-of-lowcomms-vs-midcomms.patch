Subject: fs: dlm: fix log of lowcomms vs midcomms

From: Alexander Aring <aahringo@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 3e54c9e80e68b765d8877023d93f1eea1b9d1c54 ]

This patch will fix a small issue when printing out that
dlm_midcomms_start() failed to start and it was printing out that the
dlm subcomponent lowcomms was failed but lowcomms is behind the midcomms
layer.
