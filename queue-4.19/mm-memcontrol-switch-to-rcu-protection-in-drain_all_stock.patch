Subject: mm: memcontrol: switch to rcu protection in drain_all_stock()

From: Roman Gushchin <guro@fb.com>

commit e1a366be5cb4f849ec4de170d50eebc08bb0af20 upstream.

Commit 72f0184c8a00 ("mm, memcg: remove hotplug locking from try_charge")
introduced css_tryget()/css_put() calls in drain_all_stock(), which are
supposed to protect the target memory cgroup from being released during
the mem_cgroup_is_descendant() call.

However, it's not completely safe.  In theory, memcg can go away between
reading stock->cached pointer and calling css_tryget().

This can happen if drain_all_stock() races with drain_local_stock()
performed on the remote cpu as a result of a work, scheduled by the
previous invocation of drain_all_stock().

The race is a bit theoretical and there are few chances to trigger it, but
the current code looks a bit confusing, so it makes sense to fix it
anyway.  The code looks like as if css_tryget() and css_put() are used to
protect stocks drainage.  It's not necessary because stocked pages are
holding references to the cached cgroup.  And it obviously won't work for
works, scheduled on other cpus.

So, let's read the stock->cached pointer and evaluate the memory cgroup
inside a rcu read section, and get rid of css_tryget()/css_put() calls.
