Subject: msm/gpu/a6xx: Force of_dma_configure to setup DMA for GMU

From: Jordan Crouse <jcrouse@codeaurora.org>

[ Upstream commit 32aa27e15c28d3898ed6f9b3c98f95f34a81eab2 ]

The point of the 'force_dma' parameter for of_dma_configure
is to force the device to be set up even if DMA capability is
not described by the firmware which is exactly the use case
 we have for GMU - we need SMMU to get set up but we have no
other dma capabilities since memory is managed by the GPU
driver. Currently we pass false so of_dma_configure() fails
and subsequently GMU and GPU probe does as well.
