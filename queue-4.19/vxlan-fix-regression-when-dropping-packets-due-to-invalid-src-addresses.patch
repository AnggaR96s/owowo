Subject: vxlan: Fix regression when dropping packets due to invalid src addresses

From: Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>

commit 1cd4bc987abb2823836cbb8f887026011ccddc8a upstream.

Commit f58f45c1e5b9 ("vxlan: drop packets from invalid src-address")
has recently been added to vxlan mainly in the context of source
address snooping/learning so that when it is enabled, an entry in the
FDB is not being created for an invalid address for the corresponding
tunnel endpoint.

Before commit f58f45c1e5b9 vxlan was similarly behaving as geneve in
that it passed through whichever macs were set in the L2 header. It
turns out that this change in behavior breaks setups, for example,
Cilium with netkit in L3 mode for Pods as well as tunnel mode has been
passing before the change in f58f45c1e5b9 for both vxlan and geneve.
After mentioned change it is only passing for geneve as in case of
vxlan packets are dropped due to vxlan_set_mac() returning false as
source and destination macs are zero which for E/W traffic via tunnel
is totally fine.

Fix it by only opting into the is_valid_ether_addr() check in
vxlan_set_mac() when in fact source address snooping/learning is
actually enabled in vxlan. This is done by moving the check into
vxlan_snoop(). With this change, the Cilium connectivity test suite
passes again for both tunnel flavors.
