Subject: platform/x86: intel-hid: Add a quirk to support HP Spectre X2 (2015)

From: Nickolai Kozachenko <daemongloom@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 8fe63eb757ac6e661a384cc760792080bdc738dc ]

HEBC method reports capabilities of 5 button array but HP Spectre X2 (2015)
does not have this control method (the same was for Wacom MobileStudio Pro).
Expand previous DMI quirk by Alex Hung to also enable 5 button array
for this system.
