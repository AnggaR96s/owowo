Subject: random: remove unused OUTPUT_POOL constants

From: "Jason A. Donenfeld" <Jason@zx2c4.com>

commit 0f63702718c91d89c922081ac1e6baeddc2d8b1a upstream.

We no longer have an output pool. Rather, we have just a wakeup bits
threshold for /dev/random reads, presumably so that processes don't
hang. This value, random_write_wakeup_bits, is configurable anyway. So
all the no longer usefully named OUTPUT_POOL constants were doing was
setting a reasonable default for random_write_wakeup_bits. This commit
gets rid of the constants and just puts it all in the default value of
random_write_wakeup_bits.
