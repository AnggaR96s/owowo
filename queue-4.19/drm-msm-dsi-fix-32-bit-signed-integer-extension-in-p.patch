Subject: drm/msm/dsi: fix 32-bit signed integer extension in pclk_rate
 calculation

From: Jonathan Marek <jonathan@marek.ca>

[ Upstream commit 358b762400bd94db2a14a72dfcef74c7da6bd845 ]

When (mode->clock * 1000) is larger than (1<<31), int to unsigned long
conversion will sign extend the int to 64 bits and the pclk_rate value
will be incorrect.

Fix this by making the result of the multiplication unsigned.

Note that above (1<<32) would still be broken and require more changes, but
its unlikely anyone will need that anytime soon.
