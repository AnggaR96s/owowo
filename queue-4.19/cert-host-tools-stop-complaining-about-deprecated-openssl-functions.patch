Subject: cert host tools: Stop complaining about deprecated OpenSSL functions

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

commit 6bfb56e93bcef41859c2d5ab234ffd80b691be35 upstream.

OpenSSL 3.0 deprecated the OpenSSL's ENGINE API.  That is as may be, but
the kernel build host tools still use it.  Disable the warning about
deprecated declarations until somebody who cares fixes it.
