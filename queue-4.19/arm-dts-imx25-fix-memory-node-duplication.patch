Subject: ARM: dts: imx25: Fix memory node duplication

From: Fabio Estevam <festevam@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 59d8bb363f563e4a147a291037bf979cb8ff9a59 ]

Boards based on imx25 have duplicate memory nodes:

- One coming from the board dts file: memory@

- One coming from the imx25.dtsi file.

Fix the duplication by removing the memory node from the dtsi file
and by adding 'device_type = "memory";' in the board dts.
