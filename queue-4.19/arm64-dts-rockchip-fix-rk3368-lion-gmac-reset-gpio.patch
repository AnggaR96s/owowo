Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: fix rk3368-lion gmac reset gpio

From: Heiko Stuebner <heiko.stuebner@theobroma-systems.com>

[ Upstream commit 2300e6dab473e93181cf76e4fe6671aa3d24c57b ]

The lion gmac node currently uses opposite active-values for the
gmac phy reset pin. The gpio-declaration uses active-high while the
separate snps,reset-active-low property marks the pin as active low.

While on the kernel side this works ok, other DT users may get
confused - as seen with uboot right now.

So bring this in line and make both properties match, similar to the
other Rockchip board.
