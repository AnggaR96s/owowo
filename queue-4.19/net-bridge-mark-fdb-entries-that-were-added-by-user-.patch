Subject: net: bridge: Mark FDB entries that were added by user as such

[ Upstream commit 710ae72877378e7cde611efd30fe90502a6e5b30 ]

Externally learned entries can be added by a user or by a switch driver
that is notifying the bridge driver about entries that were learned in
hardware.

In the first case, the entries are not marked with the 'added_by_user'
flag, which causes switch drivers to ignore them and not offload them.

The 'added_by_user' flag can be set on externally learned FDB entries
based on the 'swdev_notify' parameter in br_fdb_external_learn_add(),
which effectively means if the created / updated FDB entry was added by
a user or not.

Fixes: 816a3bed9549 ("switchdev: Add fdb.added_by_user to switchdev notifications")
