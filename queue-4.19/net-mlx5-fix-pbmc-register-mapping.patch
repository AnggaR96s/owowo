Subject: net/mlx5: Fix PBMC register mapping

From: Aya Levin <ayal@nvidia.com>

[ Upstream commit 534b1204ca4694db1093b15cf3e79a99fcb6a6da ]

Add reserved mapping to cover all the register in order to avoid setting
arbitrary values to newer FW which implements the reserved fields.

Fixes: 50b4a3c23646 ("net/mlx5: PPTB and PBMC register firmware command support")
