Subject: nfit/ars: Attempt a short-ARS whenever the ARS state is idle at boot

From: Dan Williams <dan.j.williams@intel.com>

commit c6c5df293bf1b488cf8459aac658aecfdccb13a9 upstream.

If query-ARS reports that ARS has stopped and requires continuation
attempt to retrieve short-ARS results before continuing the long
operation.

Fixes: bc6ba8085842 ("nfit, address-range-scrub: rework and simplify ARS...")
