Subject: arm64: lse: Make ARM64_LSE_ATOMICS depend on JUMP_LABEL

[ Upstream commit b32baf91f60fb9c7010bff87e68132f2ce31d9a8 ]

Support for LSE atomic instructions (CONFIG_ARM64_LSE_ATOMICS) relies on
a static key to select between the legacy LL/SC implementation which is
available on all arm64 CPUs and the super-duper LSE implementation which
is available on CPUs implementing v8.1 and later.

Unfortunately, when building a kernel with CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL disabled
(e.g. because the toolchain doesn't support 'asm goto'), the static key
inside the atomics code tries to use atomics itself. This results in a
mess of circular includes and a build failure:

In file included from ./arch/arm64/include/asm/lse.h:11,
                 from ./arch/arm64/include/asm/atomic.h:16,

                 from ./include/linux/page-flags.h:10,
                 from kernel/bounds.c:10:
./include/linux/jump_label.h: In function ‘static_key_count’:
./include/linux/jump_label.h:254:9: error: implicit declaration of function ‘atomic_read’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
  return atomic_read(&key->enabled);
         ^~~~~~~~~~~

[ ... more of the same ... ]

Since LSE atomic instructions are not critical to the operation of the
kernel, make them depend on JUMP_LABEL at compile time.
