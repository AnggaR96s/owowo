Subject: Smack:- Use overlay inode label in smack_inode_copy_up()

From: Vishal Goel <vishal.goel@samsung.com>

commit 387ef964460f14fe1c1ea29aba70e22731ea7cf7 upstream.

Currently in "smack_inode_copy_up()" function, process label is
changed with the label on parent inode. Due to which,
process is assigned directory label and whatever file or directory
created by the process are also getting directory label
which is wrong label.

Changes has been done to use label of overlay inode instead
of parent inode.
