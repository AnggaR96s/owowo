Subject: ARM: dts: rockchip: fix rk3288 cpu opp node reference

From: Jonas Karlman <jonas@kwiboo.se>

commit 6b2fde3dbfab6ebc45b0cd605e17ca5057ff9a3b upstream.

The following error can be seen during boot:

  of: /cpus/cpu@501: Couldn't find opp node

Change cpu nodes to use operating-points-v2 in order to fix this.
