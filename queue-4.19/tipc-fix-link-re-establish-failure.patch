Subject: tipc: fix link re-establish failure

From: Jon Maloy <donmalo99@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 7ab412d33b4c7ff3e0148d3db25dd861edd1283d ]

When a link failure is detected locally, the link is reset, the flag
link->in_session is set to false, and a RESET_MSG with the 'stopping'
bit set is sent to the peer.

The purpose of this bit is to inform the peer that this endpoint just
is going down, and that the peer should handle the reception of this
particular RESET message as a local failure. This forces the peer to
accept another RESET or ACTIVATE message from this endpoint before it
can re-establish the link. This again is necessary to ensure that
link session numbers are properly exchanged before the link comes up
again.

If a failure is detected locally at the same time at the peer endpoint
this will do the same, which is also a correct behavior.

However, when receiving such messages, the endpoints will not
distinguish between 'stopping' RESETs and ordinary ones when it comes
to updating session numbers. Both endpoints will copy the received
session number and set their 'in_session' flags to true at the
reception, while they are still expecting another RESET from the
peer before they can go ahead and re-establish. This is contradictory,
since, after applying the validation check referred to below, the
'in_session' flag will cause rejection of all such messages, and the
link will never come up again.

We now fix this by not only handling received RESET/STOPPING messages
as a local failure, but also by omitting to set a new session number
and the 'in_session' flag in such cases.
