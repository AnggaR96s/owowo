Subject: powerpc/tm: Fix HFSCR bit for no suspend case

From: Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>

commit dd9a8c5a87395b6f05552c3b44e42fdc95760552 upstream.

Currently on P9N DD2.1 we end up taking infinite TM facility
unavailable exceptions on the first TM usage by userspace.

In the special case of TM no suspend (P9N DD2.1), Linux is told TM is
off via CPU dt-ftrs but told to (partially) use it via
OPAL_REINIT_CPUS_TM_SUSPEND_DISABLED. So HFSCR[TM] will be off from
dt-ftrs but we need to turn it on for the no suspend case.

This patch fixes this by enabling HFSCR TM in this case.
