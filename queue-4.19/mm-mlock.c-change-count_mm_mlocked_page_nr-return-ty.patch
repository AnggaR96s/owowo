Subject: mm/mlock.c: change count_mm_mlocked_page_nr return type

[ Upstream commit 0874bb49bb21bf24deda853e8bf61b8325e24bcb ]

On a 64-bit machine the value of "vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start" may be
negative when using 32 bit ints and the "count >> PAGE_SHIFT"'s result
will be wrong.  So change the local variable and return value to
unsigned long to fix the problem.
