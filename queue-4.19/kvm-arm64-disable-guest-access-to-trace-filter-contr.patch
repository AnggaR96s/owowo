Subject: KVM: arm64: Disable guest access to trace filter controls

From: Suzuki K Poulose <suzuki.poulose@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit a354a64d91eec3e0f8ef0eed575b480fd75b999c ]

Disable guest access to the Trace Filter control registers.
We do not advertise the Trace filter feature to the guest
(ID_AA64DFR0_EL1: TRACE_FILT is cleared) already, but the guest
can still access the TRFCR_EL1 unless we trap it.

This will also make sure that the guest cannot fiddle with
the filtering controls set by a nvhe host.
