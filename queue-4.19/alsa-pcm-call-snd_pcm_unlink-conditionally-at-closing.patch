Subject: ALSA: pcm: Call snd_pcm_unlink() conditionally at closing

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit b51abed8355e5556886623b2772fa6b7598d2282 upstream.

Currently the PCM core calls snd_pcm_unlink() always unconditionally
at closing a stream.  However, since snd_pcm_unlink() invokes the
global rwsem down, the lock can be easily contended.  More badly, when
a thread runs in a high priority RT-FIFO, it may stall at spinning.

Basically the call of snd_pcm_unlink() is required only for the linked
streams that are already rare occasion.  For normal use cases, this
code path is fairly superfluous.

As an optimization (and also as a workaround for the RT problem
above in normal situations without linked streams), this patch adds a
check before calling snd_pcm_unlink() and calls it only when needed.
