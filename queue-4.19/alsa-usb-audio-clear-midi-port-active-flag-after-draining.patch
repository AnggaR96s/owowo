Subject: ALSA: usb-audio: Clear MIDI port active flag after draining

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 0665886ad1392e6b5bae85d7a6ccbed48dca1522 upstream.

When a rawmidi output stream is closed, it calls the drain at first,
then does trigger-off only when the drain returns -ERESTARTSYS as a
fallback.  It implies that each driver should turn off the stream
properly after the drain.  Meanwhile, USB-audio MIDI interface didn't
change the port->active flag after the drain.  This may leave the
output work picking up the port that is closed right now, which
eventually leads to a use-after-free for the already released rawmidi
object.

This patch fixes the bug by properly clearing the port->active flag
after the output drain.
