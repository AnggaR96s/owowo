Subject: ASoC: cs4349: Use PM ops 'cs4349_runtime_pm'

From: YueHaibing <yuehaibing@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit 9b4275c415acca6264a3d7f1182589959c93d530 ]

sound/soc/codecs/cs4349.c:358:32: warning:
 cs4349_runtime_pm defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]

cs4349_runtime_pm ops already defined, it seems
we should enable it.
