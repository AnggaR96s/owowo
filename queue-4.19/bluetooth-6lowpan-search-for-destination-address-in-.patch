Subject: Bluetooth: 6lowpan: search for destination address in all peers

[ Upstream commit b188b03270b7f8568fc714101ce82fbf5e811c5a ]

Handle overlooked case where the target address is assigned to a peer
and neither route nor gateway exist.

For one peer, no checks are performed to see if it is meant to receive
packets for a given address.

As soon as there is a second peer however, checks are performed
to deal with routes and gateways for handling complex setups with
multiple hops to a target address.
This logic assumed that no route and no gateway imply that the
destination address can not be reached, which is false in case of a
direct peer.
