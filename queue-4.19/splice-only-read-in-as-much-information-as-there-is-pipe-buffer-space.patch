Subject: splice: only read in as much information as there is pipe buffer space

commit 3253d9d093376d62b4a56e609f15d2ec5085ac73 upstream.

Andreas Grünbacher reports that on the two filesystems that support
iomap directio, it's possible for splice() to return -EAGAIN (instead of
a short splice) if the pipe being written to has less space available in
its pipe buffers than the length supplied by the calling process.

Months ago we fixed splice_direct_to_actor to clamp the length of the
read request to the size of the splice pipe.  Do the same to do_splice.

Fixes: 17614445576b6 ("splice: don't read more than available pipe space")
