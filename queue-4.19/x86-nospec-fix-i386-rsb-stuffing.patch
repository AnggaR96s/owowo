Subject: x86/nospec: Fix i386 RSB stuffing

From: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>

commit 332924973725e8cdcc783c175f68cf7e162cb9e5 upstream.

Turns out that i386 doesn't unconditionally have LFENCE, as such the
loop in __FILL_RETURN_BUFFER isn't actually speculation safe on such
chips.

Fixes: ba6e31af2be9 ("x86/speculation: Add LFENCE to RSB fill sequence")

[bwh: Backported to 4.19/5.4:
 - __FILL_RETURN_BUFFER takes an sp parameter
 - Open-code __FILL_RETURN_SLOT]
