Subject: drm/i915: Restore sane defaults for KMS on GEM error load
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

[ Upstream commit 7ed43df720c007d60bee6d81da07bcdc7e4a55ae ]

If we fail during GEM initialisation, we scrub the HW state by
performing a device level GPU resuet. However, we want to leave the
system in a usable state (with functioning KMS but no GEM) so after
scrubbing the HW state, we need to restore some sane defaults and
re-enable the low-level common parts of the GPU (such as the GMCH).

v2: Restore GTT entries.
