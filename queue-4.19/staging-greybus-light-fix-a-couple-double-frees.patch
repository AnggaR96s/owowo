Subject: staging: greybus: light: fix a couple double frees

From: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>

[ Upstream commit 329101244f214952606359d254ae883b7109e1a5 ]

The problem is in gb_lights_request_handler().  If we get a request to
change the config then we release the light with gb_lights_light_release()
and re-allocated it.  However, if the allocation fails part way through
then we call gb_lights_light_release() again.  This can lead to a couple
different double frees where we haven't cleared out the original values:

	gb_lights_light_v4l2_unregister(light);
	...
	kfree(light->channels);
	kfree(light->name);

I also made a small change to how we set "light->channels_count = 0;".
The original code handled this part fine and did not cause a use after
free but it was sort of complicated to read.
