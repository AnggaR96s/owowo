Subject: regulator: defer probe when trying to get voltage from unresolved
 supply

[ Upstream commit cf1ad559a20d1930aa7b47a52f54e1f8718de301 ]

regulator_get_voltage_rdev() is called in regulator probe() when
applying machine constraints.  The "fixed" commit exposed the problem
that non-bypassed regulators can forward the request to its parent
(like bypassed ones) supply. Return -EPROBE_DEFER when the supply
is expected but not resolved yet.

Fixes: aea6cb99703e ("regulator: resolve supply after creating regulator")
