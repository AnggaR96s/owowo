Subject: mm: thp: fix MADV_DONTNEED vs migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page race
 condition

From: Andrea Arcangeli <aarcange@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit d7c3393413fe7e7dc54498ea200ea94742d61e18 ]

Patch series "migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page race conditions".

Aaron found a new instance of the THP MADV_DONTNEED race against
pmdp_clear_flush* variants, that was apparently left unfixed.

While looking into the race found by Aaron, I may have found two more
issues in migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page.

These race conditions would not cause kernel instability, but they'd
corrupt userland data or leave data non zero after MADV_DONTNEED.

I did only minor testing, and I don't expect to be able to reproduce this
(especially the lack of ->invalidate_range before migrate_page_copy,
requires the latest iommu hardware or infiniband to reproduce).  The last
patch is noop for x86 and it needs further review from maintainers of
archs that implement flush_cache_range() (not in CC yet).

To avoid confusion, it's not the first patch that introduces the bug fixed
in the second patch, even before removing the
pmdp_huge_clear_flush_notify, that _notify suffix was called after
migrate_page_copy already run.

This patch (of 3):

This is a corollary of ced108037c2aa ("thp: fix MADV_DONTNEED vs.  numa
balancing race"), 58ceeb6bec8 ("thp: fix MADV_DONTNEED vs.  MADV_FREE
race") and 5b7abeae3af8c ("thp: fix MADV_DONTNEED vs clear soft dirty
race).

When the above three fixes where posted Dave asked
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/929b3844-aec2-0111-fef7-8002f9d4e2b9@intel.com
but apparently this was missed.

The pmdp_clear_flush* in migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page() was introduced
in a54a407fbf7 ("mm: Close races between THP migration and PMD numa
clearing").

The important part of such commit is only the part where the page lock is
not released until the first do_huge_pmd_numa_page() finished disarming
the pagenuma/protnone.

The addition of pmdp_clear_flush() wasn't beneficial to such commit and
there's no commentary about such an addition either.

I guess the pmdp_clear_flush() in such commit was added just in case for
safety, but it ended up introducing the MADV_DONTNEED race condition found
by Aaron.

At that point in time nobody thought of such kind of MADV_DONTNEED race
conditions yet (they were fixed later) so the code may have looked more
robust by adding the pmdp_clear_flush().

This specific race condition won't destabilize the kernel, but it can
confuse userland because after MADV_DONTNEED the memory won't be zeroed
out.

This also optimizes the code and removes a superfluous TLB flush.
