Subject: ARM: dts: sun8i: h3-h5: ir register size should be the whole memory
 block

From: Philipp Rossak <embed3d@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 6c700289a3e84d5d3f2a95cf27732a7f7fce105b ]

The size of the register should be the size of the whole memory block,
not just the registers, that are needed.
