Subject: mmc: sdio: Don't re-initialize powered-on removable SDIO cards at
 resume

From: Ulf Hansson <ulf.hansson@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 6ebc581c3f9e6fd11a1c9da492a5e05bbe96885a ]

It looks like the original idea behind always doing a re-initialization of
a removable SDIO card during system resume in mmc_sdio_resume(), is to try
to play safe to detect whether the card has been removed.

However, this seems like a really a bad idea as it will most likely screw
things up, especially when the card is expected to remain powered on during
system suspend by the SDIO func driver.

Let's fix this, simply by trusting that the detect work checks if the card
is alive and inserted, which is being scheduled at the PM_POST_SUSPEND
notification anyway.
