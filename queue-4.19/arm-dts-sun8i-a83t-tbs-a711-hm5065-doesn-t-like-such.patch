Subject: ARM: dts: sun8i-a83t-tbs-a711: HM5065 doesn't like such a high
 voltage

From: Ondrej Jirman <megous@megous.com>

[ Upstream commit a40550952c000667b20082d58077bc647da6c890 ]

Lowering the voltage solves the quick image degradation over time
(minutes), that was probably caused by overheating.
