Subject: mmc: dw_mmc-bluefield: : Fix the license information

From: Liming Sun <lsun@mellanox.com>

commit f3716b8ae9347797b73896725f192c3a7b0069b5 upstream.

The SPDX license identifier and the boiler plate text are
contradicting. Only the SPDX license identifier is needed. The
other one is removed.

Fixes: 86958dcc5ad7 ("mmc: dw_mmc-bluefield: Add driver extension")
