Subject: ARM: dts: sun8i: a33: Reintroduce default pinctrl muxing

From: Maxime Ripard <maxime.ripard@bootlin.com>

[ Upstream commit fa44328f4eb0b762a1fcb148809068e9646e7156 ]

Commit d02752149759 ("ARM: dts: sun8i-a23-a33: Move NAND controller device
node to sort by address") moved the NAND controller node around, but
dropped the default muxing in the process.

Reintroduce it.

Fixes: d02752149759 ("ARM: dts: sun8i-a23-a33: Move NAND controller device node to sort by address")
