Subject: x86/kvm/nVMX: read from MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2 only when it is available

From: Vitaly Kuznetsov <vkuznets@redhat.com>

commit 6b1971c694975e49af302229202c0043568b1791 upstream.

SDM says MSR_IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2 is only available "If
(CPUID.01H:ECX.[5] && IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS[63])". It was found that
some old cpus (namely "Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU 6600 @ 2.40GHz (family: 0x6,
model: 0xf, stepping: 0x6") don't have it. Add the missing check.
