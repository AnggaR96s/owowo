Subject: scsi: fcoe: Memory leak fix in fcoe_sysfs_fcf_del()

From: Javed Hasan <jhasan@marvell.com>

[ Upstream commit e95b4789ff4380733006836d28e554dc296b2298 ]

In fcoe_sysfs_fcf_del(), we first deleted the fcf from the list and then
freed it if ctlr_dev was not NULL. This was causing a memory leak.

Free the fcf even if ctlr_dev is NULL.
