Subject: net/wan: fix a double free in x25_asy_open_tty()

From: Cong Wang <xiyou.wangcong@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit d5c7c745f254c6cb98b3b3f15fe789b8bd770c72 ]

When x25_asy_open() fails, it already cleans up by itself,
so its caller doesn't need to free the memory again.

It seems we still have to call x25_asy_free() to clear the SLF_INUSE
bit, so just set these pointers to NULL after kfree().
