Subject: drivers/net/wan/lapbether: Set network_header before transmitting

From: Xie He <xie.he.0141@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 91244d108441013b7367b3b4dcc6869998676473 ]

Set the skb's network_header before it is passed to the underlying
Ethernet device for transmission.

This patch fixes the following issue:

When we use this driver with AF_PACKET sockets, there would be error
messages of:
   protocol 0805 is buggy, dev (Ethernet interface name)
printed in the system "dmesg" log.

This is because skbs passed down to the Ethernet device for transmission
don't have their network_header properly set, and the dev_queue_xmit_nit
function in net/core/dev.c complains about this.

Reason of setting the network_header to this place (at the end of the
Ethernet header, and at the beginning of the Ethernet payload):

Because when this driver receives an skb from the Ethernet device, the
network_header is also set at this place.
