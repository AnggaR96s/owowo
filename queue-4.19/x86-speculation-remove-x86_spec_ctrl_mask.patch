Subject: x86/speculation: Remove x86_spec_ctrl_mask
To: stable@vger.kernel.org
Cc: x86@kernel.org, kvm@vger.kernel.org, bp@alien8.de, pbonzini@redhat.com, peterz@infradead.org, jpoimboe@kernel.org, cascardo@canonical.com, surajjs@amazon.com, ssouhlal@FreeBSD.org, suleiman@google.com
Message-ID: <20221117091952.1940850-25-suleiman@google.com>

From: Josh Poimboeuf <jpoimboe@kernel.org>

commit acac5e98ef8d638a411cfa2ee676c87e1973f126 upstream.

This mask has been made redundant by kvm_spec_ctrl_test_value().  And it
doesn't even work when MSR interception is disabled, as the guest can
just write to SPEC_CTRL directly.
