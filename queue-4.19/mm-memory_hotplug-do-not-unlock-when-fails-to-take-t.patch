Subject: mm/memory_hotplug: Do not unlock when fails to take the
 device_hotplug_lock

From: zhong jiang <zhongjiang@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit d2ab99403ee00d8014e651728a4702ea1ae5e52c ]

When adding the memory by probing memory block in sysfs interface, there is an
obvious issue that we will unlock the device_hotplug_lock when fails to takes it.

That issue was introduced in Commit 8df1d0e4a265
("mm/memory_hotplug: make add_memory() take the device_hotplug_lock")

We should drop out in time when fails to take the device_hotplug_lock.

Fixes: 8df1d0e4a265 ("mm/memory_hotplug: make add_memory() take the device_hotplug_lock")
