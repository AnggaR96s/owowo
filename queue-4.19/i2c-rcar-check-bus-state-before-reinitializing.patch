Subject: i2c: rcar: check bus state before reinitializing

[ Upstream commit 0b57436f15bf40e432487086c4f2d01fd3529393 ]

We should check the bus state before reinitializing the IP core.
Otherwise, the internal bus busy state which also tracks multi-master
activity is lost.

Credits go to the Renesas BSP team for suggesting this change.
