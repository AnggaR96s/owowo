Subject: ethernet: add a helper for assigning port addresses

From: Jakub Kicinski <kuba@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit e80094a473eefad9d856ce3ab0d7afdbb64800c4 ]

We have 5 drivers which offset base MAC addr by port id.
Create a helper for them.

This helper takes care of overflows, which some drivers
did not do, please complain if that's going to break
anything!
