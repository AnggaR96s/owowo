Subject: rds: add missing barrier to release_refill

From: Mikulas Patocka <mpatocka@redhat.com>

commit 9f414eb409daf4f778f011cf8266d36896bb930b upstream.

The functions clear_bit and set_bit do not imply a memory barrier, thus it
may be possible that the waitqueue_active function (which does not take
any locks) is moved before clear_bit and it could miss a wakeup event.

Fix this bug by adding a memory barrier after clear_bit.
