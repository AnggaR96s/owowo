Subject: mmc: meson-gx: also check SD_IO_RW_EXTENDED for scatterlist size alignment

From: Neil Armstrong <narmstrong@baylibre.com>

commit 9b81354d7ebc1fd17f666a168dcabf27dae290bd upstream.

The brcmfmac driver can generate a scatterlist from a skb with each packets
not aligned to the block size. This is not supported by the Amlogic Descriptor
dma engine where each descriptor must match a multiple of the block size.

The sg list is valid, since the sum of the sg buffers is a multiple of the
block size, but we must discard those when in SD_IO_RW_EXTENDED mode since
SDIO block mode can be used under the hood even with data->blocks == 1.

Those transfers are very rare, thus can be replaced by a bounce buffer
without real performance loss.

Fixes: 7412dee9f1fd ("mmc: meson-gx: replace WARN_ONCE with dev_warn_once about scatterlist size alignment in block mode")
