Subject: ALSA: sb8: Add a comment note regarding an unused pointer

From: Atul Gopinathan <atulgopinathan@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit a28591f61b60fac820c6de59826ffa710e5e314e ]

The field "fm_res" of "struct snd_sb8" is never used/dereferenced
throughout the sb8.c code. Therefore there is no need for any null value
check after the "request_region()".

Add a comment note to make developers know about this and prevent any
"NULL check" patches on this part of code.
