Subject: KVM: arm64: vgic-debug: Don't put unmarked LPIs

From: Zenghui Yu <yuzenghui@huawei.com>

commit 2240a50e6294214de791729e9dcba6880fa7e44e upstream.

If there were LPIs being mapped behind our back (i.e., between .start() and
.stop()), we would put them at iter_unmark_lpis() without checking if they
were actually *marked*, which is obviously not good.

Switch to use the xa_for_each_marked() iterator to fix it.
