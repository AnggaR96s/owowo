Subject: platform/arm64: build drivers even on non-ARM64 platforms

[ Upstream commit 13bbe1c83bc401c2538c758228d27b4042b08341 ]

The Kconfig for platforms/arm64 has 'depends on ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST'.
However due to Makefile having just obj-$(CONFIG_ARM64) the subdir will
not be descended for !ARM64 platforms and thus the drivers won't get
built. This breaks modular builds of other driver drivers which depend
on arm64 platform drivers.
