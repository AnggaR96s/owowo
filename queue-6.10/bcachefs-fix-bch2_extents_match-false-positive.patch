Subject: bcachefs: Fix bch2_extents_match() false positive

From: Kent Overstreet <kent.overstreet@linux.dev>

[ Upstream commit  d26935690c03fe8159d42358bed1c56252700cd1 ]

This was caught as a very rare nonce inconsistency, on systems with
encryption and replication (and tiering, or some form of rebalance
operation running):

[Wed Jul 17 13:30:03 2024] bcachefs (cca5bc65-fe77-409d-a9fa-465a6e7f4eae): fatal error - emergency read only

bch2_extents_match() was reporting true for extents that did not
actually point to the same data.

bch2_extent_match() iterates over pairs of pointers, looking for
pointers that point to the same location on disk (with matching
generation numbers). However one or both extents may have been trimmed
(or merged) and they might not have the same disk offset: it corrects
for this by subtracting the key offset and the checksum entry offset.

However, this failed when an extent was immediately partially
overwritten, and the new overwrite was allocated the next adjacent disk
space.

Normally, with compression off, this would never cause a bug, since the
new extent would have to be immediately after the old extent for the
pointer offsets to match, and the rebalance index update path is not
looking for an extent outside the range of the extent it moved.

However with compression enabled, extents take up less space on disk
than they do in the btree index space - and spuriously matching after
partial overwrite is possible.

To fix this, add a secondary check, that strictly checks that the
regions pointed to on disk overlap.
