Subject: iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Avoid uninitialized asid in case of error

From: Mostafa Saleh <smostafa@google.com>

[ Upstream commit d3867e7148318e12b5d69b64950622f5ed06fe86 ]

Static checker is complaining about the ASID possibly set uninitialized.
This only happens in case of error and this value would be ignored anyway.

A simple fix would be just to initialize the local variable to zero,
this path will only be reached on the first attach to a domain where
the CD is already initialized to zero.
This avoids having to bloat the function with an error path.
