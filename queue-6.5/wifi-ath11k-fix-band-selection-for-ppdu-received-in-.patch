Subject: wifi: ath11k: fix band selection for ppdu received in channel 177 of
 5 GHz

From: Aditya Kumar Singh <quic_adisi@quicinc.com>

[ Upstream commit 72c8caf904aed2caed5d6e75233294b6159ddb5d ]

5 GHz band channel 177 support was added with the commit e5e94d10c856 ("wifi:
ath11k: add channel 177 into 5 GHz channel list"). However, during processing
for the received ppdu in ath11k_dp_rx_h_ppdu(), channel number is checked only
till 173. This leads to driver code checking for channel and then fetching the
band from it which is extra effort since firmware has already given the channel
number in the metadata.

Fix this issue by checking the channel number till 177 since we support
it now.

Found via code review. Compile tested only.
