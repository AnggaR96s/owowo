Subject: powerpc/ftrace: Fix dropping weak symbols with older toolchains

From: Naveen N Rao <naveen@kernel.org>

commit f6834c8c59a8e977a6f6e4f96c5d28dfa5db8430 upstream.

The minimum level of gcc supported for building the kernel is v5.1.
v5.x releases of gcc emitted a three instruction sequence for
-mprofile-kernel:
	mflr	r0
	std	r0, 16(r1)
	bl	_mcount

It is only with the v6.x releases that gcc started emitting the two
instruction sequence for -mprofile-kernel, omitting the second store
instruction.

With the older three instruction sequence, the actual ftrace location
can be the 5th instruction into a function. Update the allowed offset
for ftrace location from 12 to 16 to accommodate the same.
