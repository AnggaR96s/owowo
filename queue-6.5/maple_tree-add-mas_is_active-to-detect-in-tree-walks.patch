Subject: maple_tree: add mas_is_active() to detect in-tree walks

From: Liam R. Howlett <Liam.Howlett@oracle.com>

[ Upstream commit 5c590804b6b0ff933ed4e5cee5d76de3a5048d9f ]

Patch series "maple_tree: Fix mas_prev() state regression".

Pedro Falcato retported an mprotect regression [1] which was bisected back
to the iterator changes for maple tree.  Root cause analysis showed the
mas_prev() running off the end of the VMA space (previous from 0) followed
by mas_find(), would skip the first value.

This patchset introduces maple state underflow/overflow so the sequence of
calls on the maple state will return what the user expects.

Users who encounter this bug may see mprotect(), userfaultfd_register(),
and mlock() fail on VMAs mapped with address 0.

This patch (of 2):

Instead of constantly checking each possibility of the maple state,
create a fast path that will skip over checking unlikely states.
