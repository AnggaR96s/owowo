Subject: nvme: fix warn output about shared namespaces without
 CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATH

From: Yi Zhang <yi.zhang@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 0bc2e80b9be51712b19e919db5abc97a418f8292 ]

Move the stray '.' that is currently at the end of the line after
newline '\n' to before newline character which is the right position.

Fixes: ce8d78616a6b ("nvme: warn about shared namespaces without CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATH")
