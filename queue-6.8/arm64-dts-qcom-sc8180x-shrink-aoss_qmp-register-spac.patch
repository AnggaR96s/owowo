Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sc8180x: Shrink aoss_qmp register space size

From: Konrad Dybcio <konrad.dybcio@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit dcad0590d1ea4278a55c30dd2903611a96111601 ]

The AOSS_QMP region is overallocated, bleeding into space that's supposed
to be used by other peripherals. Fix it.

Fixes: 8575f197b077 ("arm64: dts: qcom: Introduce the SC8180x platform")
