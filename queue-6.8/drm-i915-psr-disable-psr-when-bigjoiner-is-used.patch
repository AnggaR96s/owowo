Subject: drm/i915/psr: Disable PSR when bigjoiner is used

commit e3d4ead4d48c05355bd3b99c8162428f68c3c1a5 upstream.

Bigjoiner seem to be causing all kinds of grief to the PSR
code currently. I don't believe there is any hardware issue
but the code simply not handling this correctly. For now
just disable PSR when bigjoiner is needed.
