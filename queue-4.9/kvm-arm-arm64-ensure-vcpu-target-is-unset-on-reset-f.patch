Subject: KVM: arm/arm64: Ensure vcpu target is unset on reset failure

[ Upstream commit 811328fc3222f7b55846de0cd0404339e2e1e6d7 ]

A failed KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT should not set the vcpu target,
as the vcpu target is used by kvm_vcpu_initialized() to
determine if other vcpu ioctls may proceed. We need to set
the target before calling kvm_reset_vcpu(), but if that call
fails, we should then unset it and clear the feature bitmap
while we're at it.
