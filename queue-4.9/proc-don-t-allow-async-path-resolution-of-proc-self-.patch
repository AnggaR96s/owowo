Subject: proc: don't allow async path resolution of /proc/self components

From: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>

[ Upstream commit 8d4c3e76e3be11a64df95ddee52e99092d42fc19 ]

If this is attempted by a kthread, then return -EOPNOTSUPP as we don't
currently support that. Once we can get task_pid_ptr() doing the right
thing, then this can go away again.
