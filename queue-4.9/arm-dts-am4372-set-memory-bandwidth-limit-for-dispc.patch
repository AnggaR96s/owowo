Subject: ARM: dts: am4372: Set memory bandwidth limit for DISPC

From: Peter Ujfalusi <peter.ujfalusi@ti.com>

[ Upstream commit f90ec6cdf674248dcad85bf9af6e064bf472b841 ]

Set memory bandwidth limit to filter out resolutions above 720p@60Hz to
avoid underflow errors due to the bandwidth needs of higher resolutions.

am43xx can not provide enough bandwidth to DISPC to correctly handle
'high' resolutions.
