Subject: iwlwifi: mvm: avoid sending too many BARs

From: Sara Sharon <sara.sharon@intel.com>

[ Upstream commit 1a19c139be18ed4d6d681049cc48586fae070120 ]

When we receive TX response, we may release a few packets
due to a hole that was closed in the transmission window.

However, if that frame failed, we will mark all the released
frames as failed and will send multiple BARs.

This affects statistics badly, and cause unnecessary frames
transmission.

Instead, mark all the following packets as success, with the
desired result of sending a bar for the failed frame only.
