Subject: bonding: fix ad_actor_system option setting to default

From: Fernando Fernandez Mancera <ffmancera@riseup.net>

[ Upstream commit 1c15b05baea71a5ff98235783e3e4ad227760876 ]

When 802.3ad bond mode is configured the ad_actor_system option is set to
"00:00:00:00:00:00". But when trying to set the all-zeroes MAC as actors'
system address it was failing with EINVAL.

An all-zeroes ethernet address is valid, only multicast addresses are not
valid values.

Fixes: 171a42c38c6e ("bonding: add netlink support for sys prio, actor sys mac, and port key")
