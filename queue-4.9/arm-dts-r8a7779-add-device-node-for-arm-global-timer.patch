Subject: ARM: dts: r8a7779: Add device node for ARM global timer

From: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>

[ Upstream commit 8443ffd1bbd5be74e9b12db234746d12e8ea93e2 ]

Add a device node for the global timer, which is part of the Cortex-A9
MPCore.

The global timer can serve as an accurate (4 ns) clock source for
scheduling and delay loops.
