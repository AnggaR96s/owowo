Subject: ima: Fix return value of ima_write_policy()

From: Roberto Sassu <roberto.sassu@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit 2e3a34e9f409ebe83d1af7cd2f49fca7af97dfac ]

This patch fixes the return value of ima_write_policy() when a new policy
is directly passed to IMA and the current policy requires appraisal of the
file containing the policy. Currently, if appraisal is not in ENFORCE mode,
ima_write_policy() returns 0 and leads user space applications to an
endless loop. Fix this issue by denying the operation regardless of the
appraisal mode.

Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # 4.10.x
Fixes: 19f8a84713edc ("ima: measure and appraise the IMA policy itself")
