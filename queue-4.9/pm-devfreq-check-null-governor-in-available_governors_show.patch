Subject: PM / devfreq: Check NULL governor in available_governors_show

From: Leonard Crestez <leonard.crestez@nxp.com>

commit d68adc8f85cd757bd33c8d7b2660ad6f16f7f3dc upstream.

The governor is initialized after sysfs attributes become visible so in
theory the governor field can be NULL here.

Fixes: bcf23c79c4e46 ("PM / devfreq: Fix available_governor sysfs")
