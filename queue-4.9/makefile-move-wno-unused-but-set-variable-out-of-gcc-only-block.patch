Subject: Makefile: Move -Wno-unused-but-set-variable out of GCC only block

From: Nathan Chancellor <nathan@kernel.org>

commit 885480b084696331bea61a4f7eba10652999a9c1 upstream.

Currently, -Wunused-but-set-variable is only supported by GCC so it is
disabled unconditionally in a GCC only block (it is enabled with W=1).
clang currently has its implementation for this warning in review so
preemptively move this statement out of the GCC only block and wrap it
with cc-disable-warning so that both compilers function the same.
