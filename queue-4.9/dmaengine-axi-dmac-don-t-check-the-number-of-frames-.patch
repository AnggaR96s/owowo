Subject: dmaengine: axi-dmac: Don't check the number of frames for alignment

From: Alexandru Ardelean <alexandru.ardelean@analog.com>

[ Upstream commit 648865a79d8ee3d1aa64aab5eb2a9d12eeed14f9 ]

In 2D transfers (for the AXI DMAC), the number of frames (numf) represents
Y_LENGTH, and the length of a frame is X_LENGTH. 2D transfers are useful
for video transfers where screen resolutions ( X * Y ) are typically
aligned for X, but not for Y.

There is no requirement for Y_LENGTH to be aligned to the bus-width (or
anything), and this is also true for AXI DMAC.

Checking the Y_LENGTH for alignment causes false errors when initiating DMA
transfers. This change fixes this by checking only that the Y_LENGTH is
non-zero.

Fixes: 0e3b67b348b8 ("dmaengine: Add support for the Analog Devices AXI-DMAC DMA controller")
