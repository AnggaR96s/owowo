Subject: arm64: dts: apq8016-sbc: Increase load on l11 for SDCARD

From: Loic Poulain <loic.poulain@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit af61bef513ba179559e56908b8c465e587bc3890 ]

In the same way as for msm8974-hammerhead, l11 load, used for SDCARD
VMMC, needs to be increased in order to prevent any voltage drop issues
(due to limited current) happening with some SDCARDS or during specific
operations (e.g. write).

Tested on Dragonboard-410c and DART-SD410 boards.

Fixes: 4c7d53d16d77 (arm64: dts: apq8016-sbc: add regulators support)
