Subject: ARM: dts: rockchip: fix pinctrl sleep nodename for rk3036-kylin and
 rk3288

From: Johan Jonker <jbx6244@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit dfbfb86a43f9a5bbd166d88bca9e07ee4e1bff31 ]

A test with the command below aimed at powerpc generates
notifications in the Rockchip ARM tree.

Fix pinctrl "sleep" nodename by renaming it to "suspend"
for rk3036-kylin and rk3288

make ARCH=arm dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/powerpc/sleep.yaml
