Subject: ASoC: ops: Reject out of bounds values in snd_soc_put_xr_sx()

From: Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>

commit 4cf28e9ae6e2e11a044be1bcbcfa1b0d8675fe4d upstream.

We don't currently validate that the values being set are within the range
we advertised to userspace as being valid, do so and reject any values
that are out of range.
