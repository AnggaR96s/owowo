Subject: usb: dwc3: gadget: Prevent core from processing stale TRBs

From: Udipto Goswami <quic_ugoswami@quicinc.com>

commit 117b4e96c7f362eb6459543883fc07f77662472c upstream.

With CPU re-ordering on write instructions, there might
be a chance that the HWO is set before the TRB is updated
with the new mapped buffer address.
And in the case where core is processing a list of TRBs
it is possible that it fetched the TRBs when the HWO is set
but before the buffer address is updated.
Prevent this by adding a memory barrier before the HWO
is updated to ensure that the core always process the
updated TRBs.
