Subject: regulator: wm831x-dcdc: Fix list of wm831x_dcdc_ilim from mA to uA

From: Axel Lin <axel.lin@ingics.com>

[ Upstream commit c25d47888f0fb3d836d68322d4aea2caf31a75a6 ]

The wm831x_dcdc_ilim entries needs to be uA because it is used to compare
with min_uA and max_uA.
While at it also make the array const and change to use unsigned int.

Fixes: e4ee831f949a ("regulator: Add WM831x DC-DC buck convertor support")
