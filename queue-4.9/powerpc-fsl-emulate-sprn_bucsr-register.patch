Subject: powerpc/fsl: Emulate SPRN_BUCSR register

commit 98518c4d8728656db349f875fcbbc7c126d4c973 upstream.

In order to flush the branch predictor the guest kernel performs
writes to the BUCSR register which is hypervisor privilleged. However,
the branch predictor is flushed at each KVM entry, so the branch
predictor has been already flushed, so just return as soon as possible
to guest.
