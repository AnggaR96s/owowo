Subject: ALSA: line6: Fix misplaced backport of "Fix wrong altsetting for LINE6_PODHD500_1"

From: Guillaume Bertholon <guillaume.bertholon@ens.fr>

The upstream commit 70256b42caaf ("ALSA: line6: Fix wrong altsetting for
LINE6_PODHD500_1") changed the .altsetting field of the LINE6_PODHD500_1
entry in podhd_properties_table from 1 to 0.

However, its backported version in stable (commit ec565611f930 ("ALSA:
line6: Fix wrong altsetting for LINE6_PODHD500_1")) change the
.altsetting field of the LINE6_PODHD500_0 entry instead.

This patch resets the altsetting of LINE6_PODHD500_0 to 1, and sets the
altsetting of LINE6_PODHD500_1 to 0, as wanted by the original fix.
