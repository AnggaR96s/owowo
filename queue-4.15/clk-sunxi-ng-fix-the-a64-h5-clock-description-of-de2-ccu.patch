Subject: clk: sunxi-ng: fix the A64/H5 clock description of DE2 CCU

From: Icenowy Zheng <icenowy@aosc.io>


[ Upstream commit cf4881c1293516c1975606e8f2af7948789168b8 ]

The clocks of A64/H5 SoCs in the DE2 CCU is the same as the clocks in H3
DE2 CCU rather than the A83T DE2 CCU (the parent of them is the DE
module clock).

Fix this by change the clock descriptions to use the clocks of H3.
