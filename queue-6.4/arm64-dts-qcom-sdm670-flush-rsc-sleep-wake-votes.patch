Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: sdm670: Flush RSC sleep & wake votes

From: Konrad Dybcio <konrad.dybcio@linaro.org>

[ Upstream commit 7b04cbd81b0e60c5151a310e7b730dc4a951a211 ]

The rpmh driver will cache sleep and wake votes until the cluster
power-domain is about to enter idle, to avoid unnecessary writes. So
associate the apps_rsc with the cluster pd, so that it can be notified
about this event.

Without this, only AMC votes are being commited.
