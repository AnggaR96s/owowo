Subject: x86: fix backwards merge of GDS/SRSO bit

Stable-tree-only change.

Due to the way the GDS and SRSO patches flowed into the stable tree, it
was a 50% chance that the merge of the which value GDS and SRSO should
be.  Of course, I lost that bet, and chose the opposite of what Linus
chose in commit 64094e7e3118 ("Merge tag 'gds-for-linus-2023-08-01' of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip")

Fix this up by switching the values to match what is now in Linus's tree
as that is the correct value to mirror.
