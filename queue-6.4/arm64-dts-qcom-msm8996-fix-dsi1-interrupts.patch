Subject: arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Fix dsi1 interrupts

From: David Wronek <davidwronek@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit bd3b4ac11845b428996cfd2c7b8302ba6a07340d ]

Fix IRQ flags mismatch which was keeping dsi1 from probing by changing
interrupts = <4> to interrupts = <5>.

Fixes: 2752bb7d9b58 ("arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: add second DSI interface")
