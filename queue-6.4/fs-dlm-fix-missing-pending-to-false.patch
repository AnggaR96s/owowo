Subject: fs: dlm: fix missing pending to false

From: Alexander Aring <aahringo@redhat.com>

commit f68bb23cad1f128198074ed7b3a4c5fb03dbd9d2 upstream.

This patch sets the process_dlm_messages_pending boolean to false when
there was no message to process. It is a case which should not happen
but if we are prepared to recover from this situation by setting pending
boolean to false.
