Subject: arm64: dts: imx95: correct the address length of netcmix_blk_ctrl

From: Wei Fang <wei.fang@nxp.com>

[ Upstream commit c5b8d2c370842e3f9a15655893d8c597e2d981d9 ]

The netc_blk_ctrl is controlled by the imx95-blk-ctl clock driver and
provides relevant clock configurations for NETC, SAI and MQS. Its address
length should be 8 bytes instead of 0x1000.

Fixes: 7764fef26ea9 ("arm64: dts: imx95: Add NETCMIX block control support")
