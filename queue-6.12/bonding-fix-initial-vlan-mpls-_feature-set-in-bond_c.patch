Subject: bonding: Fix initial {vlan,mpls}_feature set in bond_compute_features

From: Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>

[ Upstream commit d064ea7fe2a24938997b5e88e6b61cbb0a4bb906 ]

If a bonding device has slave devices, then the current logic to derive
the feature set for the master bond device is limited in that flags which
are fully supported by the underlying slave devices cannot be propagated
up to vlan devices which sit on top of bond devices. Instead, these get
blindly masked out via current NETIF_F_ALL_FOR_ALL logic.

vlan_features and mpls_features should reuse netdev_base_features() in
order derive the set in the same way as ndo_fix_features before iterating
through the slave devices to refine the feature set.

Fixes: a9b3ace44c7d ("bonding: fix vlan_features computing")
Fixes: 2e770b507ccd ("net: bonding: Inherit MPLS features from slave devices")
