Subject: dsa: qca8k: Use nested lock to avoid splat

From: Andrew Lunn <andrew@lunn.ch>

[ Upstream commit 078e0d596f7b5952dad8662ace8f20ed2165e2ce ]

qca8k_phy_eth_command() is used to probe the child MDIO bus while the
parent MDIO is locked. This causes lockdep splat, reporting a possible
deadlock. It is not an actually deadlock, because different locks are
used. By making use of mutex_lock_nested() we can avoid this false
positive.
