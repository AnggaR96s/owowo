Subject: regulator: qcom-smd: make smd_vreg_rpm static

From: Min-Hua Chen <minhuadotchen@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 18be43aca2c0ec475037923a8086d0a29fcc9d16 ]

Since smd_vreg_rpm is used only in
drivers/regulator/qcom_smd-regulator.c, make it static and fix the
following sparse warning:

drivers/regulator/qcom_smd-regulator.c:14:21: sparse: warning:
symbol 'smd_vreg_rpm' was not declared. Should it be static?

No functional changes intended.

Fixes: 5df3b41bd6b5 ("regulator: qcom_smd: Keep one rpm handle for all vregs")
