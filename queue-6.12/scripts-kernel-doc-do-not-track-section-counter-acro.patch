Subject: scripts/kernel-doc: Do not track section counter across processed
 files

From: Chen-Yu Tsai <wenst@chromium.org>

[ Upstream commit be9264110e4e874622d588a75daf930539fdf6ea ]

The section counter tracks how many sections of kernel-doc were added.
The only real use of the counter value is to check if anything was
actually supposed to be output and give a warning is nothing is
available.

The current logic of remembering the initial value and then resetting
the value then when processing each file means that if a file has the
same number of sections as the previously processed one, a warning is
incorrectly given.
